I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. degree at Beihang University. Previously, I received the M.Sc. degree from Beijing Institute of Technology in 2022, and the B.Eng. degree from Wuhan University of Technology in 2015.

My research interests lie in the fields of medical image analysis and graph representation learning, with a focus on developing deep learning methods for efficient and interpretable modeling in biomedical imaging tasks.
