My name is Nicolas BESNARD, and I'm a young and passionate embedded software engineer. I graduated in 2022 in embedded system and since worked in automotive and currently on an open-source and embedded operating system (prplOS) for network devices. I'm constantly looking for new projects to start (and I hope I will finish...) or new skills and technologies to learn. 

I started playing with software and electronics almost 10 years ago, when I was still in high school. During this time, I did a lot of different personal and school projects.
Although they are probably mostly uninteresting, I would have loved to be able to reflect on my train of thought, why I made these choices, and the mistake I made.

And because it is never too late, I have decided to write this blog with the main objective of keeping a record of my new projects, thoughts, and knowledge. 
At the same time, it is also an opportunity for me to improve my technical, communication, and writing skills as a complete beginner blogger. So please don't judge this website too hard; it has no ambition to grow or attract readers but mainly serves as a personal place to archive my projects and talk about my passion.
You might ask me why I don't keep all of this private and away from the internet's indiscreet and careless eyes.

To be honest, that is what I had planned to do first. But then I remembered that my friends, family, or coworkers had been interested in some of my projects, and this website could be a good way to let them know what I do. 

Another advantage of writing publicly is that it creates just a nice pressure on me to meet a minimum quality standard before publishing a post, making it more understandable and detailed.


PS: If you come from the far future and see this website having no recent activities, I probably gave up on it because of a lack of motivation or time...
