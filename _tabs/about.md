Hi, Thank you for visiting my homepage. I am an undergraduate student majoring in computer science and technology from Hefei University of Technology. My current research area focuses on Explainable AI, Large Language Models, and secure code generation. 

I am currently a Ph.D. student at Kansas State University, and 2023 fall is my first semester. My professors are [Prof. Eugene Vasserman](https://people.cs.ksu.edu/~eyv/) and [Prof. Pascal Hitzler](https://people.cs.ksu.edu/~hitzler/). 

Hope technology makes our life better ^-^.
