# Handling the Question


* **Communicate**: A key goal of system design questions is to evaluate your ability to communicate. Stay engaged with the interviewer. Ask them questions. Be open about the issues of your system.
* **Go broad first**: Don't dive straight into the algorithm part or get excessively focused on one part.
* **Use the whiteboard**: Using a whiteboard helps your interviewer follow your proposed design. Get up to the whiteboard in the very beginning and use it to draw a picture of what you're proposing.
* **Acknowledge interview concerns**: Your interviewer will likely jump in with concers. Don't brush them off; validate them. Acknowledge the issues your interviewer points out and make changes accordingly.
* **Be careful about assumptions**: An incorrect assumption can dramatically change the problem.
* **State your assumptions explicitly**: When you do make assumptions, state them. This allows your interviewer to correct you if you're mistaken, and shows that you at least know what assumptions you're making.
* **Estimate when necessary**: In many cases, you might not have the data you need. You can estimate this with other data you know.
* **Drive**: As the candidate, you should stay in the driver's seat. This doesn't mean you don't talk to your interviewer; in fact, you _must_ talk to your interviewer. However, you should be driving through the question. Ask questions. Be open about tradeoffs. Continue to go deeper. Continue to make improvements.

## Design

1. Scope the Problem
2. Make Reasonable Assumption
3. Draw the Major Components
4. Identify the Key Issues
5. Redesign for the Key Issues

## Algorithms that Scale

In some cases, you're being asked to design a single feature or algorithm, but you have to do it in a scalable way.

1. Ask Questiosn
2. Make Believe
3. Get Real
4. Solve Problems

like write a script to scrape information from a website,

or implement basic ciphers or make a power password brute force tool to generate credentials and store successful logins.

And then they also might cover things like intrusion detection, analysis, malware, and security architecture.
