# Redis



- Remote Dictionary Server

- a fast, open source, in-memory, key-value data store.
- The project started when Salvatore Sanfilippo, the original developer of Redis, wanted to improve the scalability of his Italian startup. From there, he developed Redis, which is now used as a `database, cache, message broker, and queue.`

- Redis delivers sub-millisecond response times, enabling millions of requests per second for real-time applications in industries like gaming, ad-tech, financial services, healthcare, and IoT. Today, Redis is one of the most popular open source engines today, named the "Most Loved" database by Stack Overflow for five consecutive years.


- Because of its fast performance, Redis is a popular choice for `caching, session management, gaming, leaderboards, real-time analytics, geospatial, ride-hailing, chat/messaging, media streaming, and pub/sub apps.`

AWS offers two fully managed services to run Redis.
- Amazon MemoryDB for Redis is a Redis-compatible, durable, in-memory database service that delivers ultra-fast performance.
- Amazon ElastiCache for Redis is a fully managed caching service that accelerates data access from primary databases and data stores with microsecond latency. ElastiCache also offers support for Memcached, another popular open source caching engine.
