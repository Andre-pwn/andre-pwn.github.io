# VMyContainer - AWS - Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service EKS

---

## basic

- a managed **Kubernetes service**


- makes it easy to run Kubernetes on AWS and on-premises without install, operate, and maintain own Kubernetes control plane.
  - Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
  - certified Kubernetes conformant, existing applications run on upstream Kubernetes are compatible with Amazon EKS.

- **automatically manages the availability and scalability of the cluster nodes** that are responsible for starting and stopping containers, scheduling containers on virtual machines, storing cluster data, and other tasks.

- automatically detects and replaces unhealthy control plane nodes for each cluster.

- both Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS capable of orchestrating Docker containers
  - provide customers with flexible options.

- Amazon EKS lets you run your Kubernetes applications on both Amazon EC2 and AWS Fargate.

- Managed Kubernetes Clusters


  - <font color=red> Managed Control Plane </font>
    - Amazon EKS provides a scalable and highly-available Kubernetes control plane running across multiple AWS Availability Zones (AZs).
    - Amazon EKS automatically manages availability and scalability of Kubernetes API servers and etcd persistence layer.
    - Amazon EKS runs the Kubernetes control plane across three AZs to ensure high availability, and automatically detects and replaces unhealthy control plane nodes.

  - <font color=red> Service Integrations </font>
    - AWS Controllers for Kubernetes (ACK) gives you direct management control over AWS services from within your Kubernetes environment.
    - ACK makes it simple to build scalable and highly available Kubernetes applications utilizing AWS services.

  - <font color=red> Hosted Kubernetes Console </font>
    - EKS provides an integrated console for **Kubernetes clusters**.
    - Cluster operators and application developers can use EKS as a single place to organize, visualize, and troubleshoot your **Kubernetes applications** running on Amazon EKS.
    - The EKS console is hosted by AWS and is available automatically for all EKS clusters.

  - <font color=red> EKS Add-Ons </font>
    - common operational software for extending the Kubernetes operational functionality.
    - use EKS to install and keep the add-on software up-to-date.
    - When start an Amazon EKS cluster, select the add-ons you would like to run in the cluster, including Kubernetes tools for observability, networking, auto-scaling, and AWS service integrations.

  - <font color=red> Managed Node Groups </font>
    - create, update, scale, and terminate nodes for your cluster with a single command.
    - These nodes can also leverage Amazon EC2 Spot Instances to reduce costs.
    - Managed node groups run Amazon EC2 instances using the latest `EKS-optimized or custom Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)` in the AWS account,
    - while updates and terminations gracefully drain nodes to ensure your applications remain available.

- Deploy across hybrid environments
  - Manage your Kubernetes clusters and applications in hybrid environments and run Kubernetes in your data centers.


- Model machine learning (ML) workflows
  - Efficiently run distributed training jobs using the latest EC2 GPU-powered instances, including Inferentia, and deploy training and inferences using Kubeflow.


- Build and run web applications
  - Create applications that automatically scale up and down and run in a highly available configuration across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) with out-of-the-box networking and security integrations.
