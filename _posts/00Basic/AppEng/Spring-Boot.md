## Spring Boot

- Spring Boot是由Pivotal团队提供的全新框架，其设计目的是用来简化新Spring应用的初始搭建以及开发过程。
- 该框架使用了特定的方式来进行配置，从而使开发人员不再需要定义样板化的配置。

- helps you to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications that you can run. We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries, so that you can get started with minimum fuss.
- Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring configuration.

- use Spring Boot to create Java applications that can be started by using java -jar or more traditional war deployments.
- We also provide a command line tool that runs “spring scripts”.


Our primary goals are:
- Provide a radically faster and widely accessible getting-started experience for all Spring development.
- Be opinionated out of the box but get out of the way quickly as requirements start to diverge from the defaults.
- Provide a range of non-functional features that are common to large classes of projects (such as embedded servers, security, metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration).
Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration.
