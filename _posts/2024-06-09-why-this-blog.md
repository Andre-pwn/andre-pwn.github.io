## This is Why

I used to have some random thoughts during my daily work. Some are deep, but some are just random. The deep ones usually circulate in my head for a long time, and I often find them worth sharing since they are sometimes helpful to someone, especially the younger ones. But most of the time, I let it sleep through and forget about it as life carries me away. This blog is for me to write down all these thoughts; it helps me organise my thinking and knowledge and acts as a medium to share those ideas. So, this is why.
