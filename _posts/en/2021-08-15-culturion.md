It is time to talk about one my proudest achievement : **Culturion**.

I intended to apply what I had learned when developing my first Android native application, Moovic. However, this time, it would be more refined and ambitious.

The first step was to come up with a game idea that could still be implemented in Android Studio and, like Moovic, was about general culture. That's how I discovered the ideal topic: a quiz on various aspects of French culture.

So I began developing the application at the end of 2020, only to put it on hold due to a lack of inspiration for the user interface. It wasn't until six months later, during the summer, that I regained my motivation thanks to one idea.
The idea was to show a blank map of France and have the player fill it in as he answered correctly. For example, guessing which city the photo was taken in reveals the city's location on a map.

Then I applied this concept to other aspects of France, such as department numbers, gastronomic dishes, and celebrity hometowns. I worked on this for several months, developing the application while also gathering all of the necessary data (city photos, culinary specialties, etc.). All of this information then had to be entered into a MySQL database.

Since the game is based on cultural knowledge and is also broken down by French region, I thought about a name and came up with "Culturion," which is a contraction of "*Culture*" and "*Region*."

I invited my family and friends to try the game once it was playable. They gave me very positive feedback, which I used to fix bugs and enhance a few features.
At last, I launched a marketing campaign and made it available to the public on the Play Store. The outcome surpassed my expectations, as I can proudly state that more than 15,000 people have downloaded it!

I will always remember this project, even though the application is no longer accessible on the Play Store due to the outdated Android SDK!
