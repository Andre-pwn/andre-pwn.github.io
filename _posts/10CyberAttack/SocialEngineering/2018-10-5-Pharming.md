## overview

- Similar in nature to  e-mail phishing,

- pharming seeks to obtain personal information by domain spoofing.
  - e-mail phishing: been spammed with malicious e-mail requests for you to visit spoof Web sites which appear egitimate.
  - scam people one at a time with an e-mail
  - Pharming: 'poisons' a DNS server, infuse false information into the DNS server, resulting in a user's request being redirected elsewhere.
  - allows the scammers to target large groups of people at one time through domain spoofing.

- Your browser, however will show you are at the correct Web site, which makes pharming more difficult to detect.
