## Responding to an Attack

When log files indicate that an intruder entered your system.

The first thing that you should do is to make a list of questions that you should begin asking to deal with the situation, questions you should consider:

1. How can you show that a break-in really occurred?

2. How can you determine the extent of what was done during the entry?

3. How can you prevent further entry?

4. Whom should you inform in your organization?

5. What should you do next?

6. who you should inform in your organization. Itâ€™s important to know the escalation procedures without hesitation and to be able to act quickly.
