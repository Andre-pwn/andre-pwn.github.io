## Man-in-the-Browser (MITB, MitB, MIB, MiB)

- a type of man-in-the-middle attack

- a proxy <font color=OrangeRed> Trojan horse </font>

- infects vulnerable web browsers.

- can capture browser session data. This includes keyloggers to capture keystrokes, along with all data sent to and from the web browser.

- <font color=LightSlateBlue> manipulates calls between the browser and its security mechanisms </font>,

- <font color=LightSlateBlue> sniffing or modifying transactions as they are formed on the browser </font>

- yet still displaying back the user’s intended transaction.


Example:

- **Zeus**:
  - a Trojan horse that has used man-in-the-browser techniques after infecting systems.

  - Zeus includes `keystroke logging` and form grabbing.

  - Once the attackers collect logon information for a user’s bank, they use it to log on and transfer money to offshore accounts.
