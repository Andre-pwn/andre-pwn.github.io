## SOAP injection

- Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) is designed to <font color=LightSlateBlue> exchange structured information </font>> in web services in computer networks and <font color=LightSlateBlue> uses XML </font>> to format information.

- You can inject malicious query strings (much like SQL injection, as a matter of fact) that may allow you to bypass authentication and access databases behind the scenes.

- SOAP is compatible with HTTP and SMTP, and messages are typically “one way” in nature.
