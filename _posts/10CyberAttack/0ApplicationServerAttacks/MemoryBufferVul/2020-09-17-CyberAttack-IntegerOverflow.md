## Integer Overflow Attack

- <font color=LightSlateBlue>use or create a numeric value that is too big for an application to handle.</font>

- Result: the application gives inaccurate results. 

- In some situations, an integer overflow error occurs if an application expects a positive number, but receives a negative number instead. 

  - If the application doesn’t have adequate error and exception-handling routines, this might cause a buffer overflow error. 

Example
- an application reserves 8 bits to store a number
  - it can store any value between 0 and 255. 
  - If the application attempts to multiply two values such as 95 × 59, the result is 5,605. 
  - <font color=LightSlateBlue>This number cannot be stored in the 8 bits</font>, causes integer overflow error.
  - double-check the size of buffers, ensure they can handle any data generated by the applications.
