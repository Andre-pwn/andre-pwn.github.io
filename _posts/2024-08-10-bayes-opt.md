Following this [Distill post on Bayesian Optimization](https://distill.pub/2020/bayesian-optimization/) very closely, I wanted to recreate the gold finding toy example using [Ax](https://ax.dev/) and [BoTorch](https://botorch.org/). Since the OP already gives a very in-depth explanation of Bayesian Optimization, I will focus on code implementation and only summarize the mathematical details of each block of code where applicable.
