# GCP - Machine Learning

## overview

- Machine learning
  - one branch of the field of artificial intelligence.
  - a way of solving problems without explicitly coding the solution.
  - Instead, build systems that improve themselves over time through repeated exposure to sample data, training data.

> Major Google applications use machine learning like YouTube, Photos, the Google Mobile App and Google Translate.


The Google Machine Learning Platform

- TensorFlow / Cloud ML

  - available as a cloud service
    - can add innovative capabilities to your own applications.

  - an open source software library
    - developed by Google Brain for Google's internal use
    - and then open source so that the world could benefit.

  - open source tool to build and run neural network models
    - exceptionally well suited for machine learning applications like neural networks.
    - wide platform support:
      - CPU or GPU; mobol, server, or cloud

  - pre-trained ML models build by Google
    - with pre-trained models and a platform to generate your own tailored models.
    - Speech:
      - stream results in real time, detects 80 languages
    - Vision:
      - identify objects, landmarks, text, and content
    - Translate:
      - language translation including detection
    - Natural language:
      - Structure, meaning of text

  - fully modern managed machine learning services
    - familiar notebook-based developer experience
    - Optimized for Google infrastructure
      - integrates with BigQuery and Cloud Storage
    - As with other GCP products, there's a range of services that stretches from the highly general to the pre-customized.

  - can run TensorFlow wherever you like
    - GCP is an ideal place
    - because machine learning models need lots of on-demand compute resources and lots of training data.

  - TensorFlow also take advantage of Tensor Processing Units
    - hardware devices
    - designed to accelerate machine learning workloads with TensorFlow.
    - GCP makes them available in the cloud with Compute Engine virtual machines.
    - Each cloud TPU provides up to 180 teraflops of performance.

  - pay for what you use
    - no upfront capital investment required.


Google Cloud Machine Learning Engine
- managed service.
  - easily build machine learning models that work on any type of data of any size.
- It can take any TensorFlow model
- and perform large-scale training on a managed cluster.

Cloud Machine Learning Platform for applications.

- Generally two categories (whether the data is structured or unstructured)
  - <font color=red> structured data </font>
    - can use ML for various kinds of classification and regression tasks
      - like customer churn analysis, product diagnostics and forecasting.
    - can be the heart of a recommendation engine
      - for content personalization and cross-sells and up-sells.
    - can use ML to detect anomalies
      - such as in fraud detection, sensor diagnostics or log metrics.

  - <font color=red> unstructured data </font>
    - can use ML for image analytics
      - such as identifying damaged shipment, identifying styles and flagging content.
    - can do text analytics
      - such as call center, blog analysis, language identification, topic classification and sentiment analysis.

- In many innovative applications for machine learning, several applications are combined.

  - one customers posted praise for one of your products on social media, your application could automatically reach out to them with a customized discount on another product they'll probably like?

#### The Cloud Vision API

- enables developers to understand the content of an image.
  - quickly classifies images into thousands of categories
  - logo/label detection
    - detects individual objects within images,
  - finds and reads printed words contained within images.
- analysis images with a simple REST API
- You can
  - use it to build metadata on your image catalog, moderate offensive content or even do image sentiment analysis.
  - gain insight from images
  - detect inappropriate content
  - analyze sentiment
  - extract text

#### The Cloud Video Intelligence API
- annotate the contents of videos
- support variety of video formats.
- detect scene changes
- flag inappropriate context
- identify key entities, nouns, within the video and when they occur.
- use it to make video content searchable and discoverable.

#### The Cloud Speech API


- enables developers to convert audio to text.
- The API recognizes over 80 languages and variants.
- You can
  - transcribe the text of users,
  - dictating in an applications' microphone,
  - enable command and control through voice or transcribe audio files.

### Language

![Screen Shot 2022-08-16 at 23.27.29](https://i.imgur.com/K18dNAM.png)

#### The Cloud Translation API
- provides a simple, programmatic interface for translating an arbitrary string into a supported language.
- the API can detect the source language
- translate arbitrary strings between thousands of language pairs

#### The Cloud Natural Language API

- offers natural language understanding technologies
- <font color=red> text/syntax analysis, reveal structure and meaning of text </font>
  - breaking down sentences supplied by our users into tokens,
  - identify the nouns, verbs, adjectives, and other parts of speech
  - and figure out the relationships among the words.
- It can extract information about items mentioned
  - do entity recognition.
  - parse text
  - and flag mentions of people, organizations, locations, events, products, and media.
- It can understand the overall sentiment expressed in a block of text.
- return text in real time
- highly accurate,
  - even in noisy environments
- access from any device
- It has these capabilities in multiple language
  - including English, Spanish, and Japanese.
