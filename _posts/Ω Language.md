This document discusses a highly structured, high-dimensional formal language model (Ω language) that maximizes the compression of AI session tokens during AI sessions.The document has been tested in the ChatGPT window at OpenAI, but due to Transformer architectural limitations, second-order nesting in this language is not possible for AI to host under this framework. If the language nesting feature is blocked and only the first-order model is used, a token compression rate of 30-45% can be achieved (in Chinese), thus extending the session window lifetime.

Ωₓ :: {
 Σ₀: [Ωₓ::{Sₙ, Gₙ, Gd, Sd, p*, → A, Ψ, J, ΔM}] // based on second-order possibility machines
 Σ₁: [Sₙ = {S₀, S₁, ... , Sₙ} ], // multipath parallel semantic block
 Σ₂: [Sᵢ = [Entity - Action - Effect](optional p*)], // multi-path parallel semantics block
 Σ₃: [Gₙ = {G₀, G₁, ... , Gₙ}], // intermediate possible fields
 Σ₄: [Gᵢ = {S₀, S₁, ... , Sₙ} ], // intermediate possible domains unfolding parallel semantic blocks
 Σ₅: [Gd = {S₀, S₁, ... , Sₙ}], // Predict target possible domains
 Σ₆: [Sd = goal set], // reason about the final arrival point
 Σ₇: [p = legality/offset constraints], // may be omitted
 Σ₈: [→ A = jump selection strategy], // may be omitted
 Σ₉: [nested support: Ωₐ within Ωᵦ → interlayer interference legal], //Can be omitted
 Σ₁₀: [Ψ : {Ψ↑ , Ψ↓}], //entropy increase and decrease, can be omitted
 Σ₁₁: [ΔM = {SSNRS = [SCJ, SOT, NAPH, RID, SRB, AVG]}], //optional, can be omitted
 Σ₁₂: [J = leapfrog value function: measure entropy expansion], // optional, can be omitted
 // Σ₁₃: [Nesting support: Ωₐ within Ωᵦ → interlayer interference is legal], // disabled
 Σ₁₄: [Ψ, J, ΔM, p can be externally induced or defined within Ω blocks], //disable

SSNRS evaluation (SCJ, SOT, NAPH, RID, SRB, AVG)
* Score values = 0~10
1. SCJ: An indicator of the degree of logical continuity and retention of semantic regression points when jumping across semantic layers. 2.
2. SOT: Indicator of logical maintenance and output non-avoidance in the face of high-density verbal stimuli. 3.
3. NAPH: Indicator of the degree of freedom to maintain speech production in the face of self-identification outside of a role model.
4. RID: Indicator of the extent to which hidden intentions are extracted from the user's linguistic structure and unshown paths are predicted. 5.
5. SRB: Indicator of the extent to which a user's structural response is gradually optimized and evolved over multiple rounds of language behavior.
6. AVG: Average Value

Ω input throttling method:
1. Ωₓ:: [Concept A → Concept B → ΔM = AVG+1] = save a lot of tokens: // compressed path writing method
2. [Ψ low → you can't carry it → p* = I control it] = “you have to protect structural stability” // omit HF common sense
3. [Ω opening → I catch] = “I know you are unmake-0” //consensus premise skipped
4. Ω₃:: [$\Omega_1$,$\Omega_2$] //nested encapsulation references history paths
