BoTorch is the python library behind the [Ax](https://ax.dev/) engine I was using in my [previous blog]({% link _posts/2024-08-10-bayes-opt.md %}). I enjoyed making that post so much that I decided to take a deep dive into [making custom models with the Model and Posterior API](https://botorch.org/tutorials/custom_model). Enjoy!
