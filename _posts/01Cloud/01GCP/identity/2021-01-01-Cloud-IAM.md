### GCP resource hierarchy

> Zones and regions physically organize the GCP resources
> Projects logically organize the GCP resources

The GCP resource hierarchy

- helps you manage resources across multiple departments and multiple teams within the organization.
- define a hierarchy to create trust boundaries in resource isolation

![Screenshot 2024-08-07 at 10.17.48](/assets/img/Screenshot%202024-08-07%20at%2010.17.48.png)

functional structure of Google Cloud consists of four levels: `resources, projects, folders, and an organization node`.

- `Resources` in Google Cloud represent virtual machines, Cloud Storage buckets, tables in BigQuery, or any other component in Google Cloud.

- `Projects` are the second level in the resource hierarchy and are used to enable and manage Google Cloud services, such as APIs, billing, collaborators, and other Google services.

  - **Project names**: can be changed and do not have to be unique.
  - **Project ID**: Each project has a unique project ID assigned by Google, which cannot be changed after creation.
  - **Project number**: Google Cloud assigns a unique project number to each project, which is mainly used internally to track resources.
  - ![Screenshot 2024-08-07 at 10.22.44](/assets/img/Screenshot%202024-08-07%20at%2010.22.44.png)

- `Folders` allow for the assignment of policies and permissions to resources at a granular level.
  - can contain projects or other folders, and resources within a folder inherit policies and permissions from that folder.
  - useful for grouping resources based on departments or teams within an organization.

- organization node
  - encompasses all projects, folders, and resources.
  - Special roles, such as `organization policy administrator` and `project creator`, can be assigned to the `organization node` to control access and permissions.
  - The creation of a new organization node depends on whether the company is a Google Workspace customer or not.
  - Folders and projects are considered "children" of the organization node.

---

#### Organization

- organization owns all the folders beneath it.

- the **root node** of a GCP resource hierarchy.

- having organization is required for you to use folders.

- G Suite customer already it

- **organization admin**:
  - provide access to administer all resources belonging to his organization
  - is useful for auditing.

- **project creator**:
  - allows a user to create projects within organization.

#### Folder

![Screen Shot 2021-06-28 at 10.43.25 PM](https://i.imgur.com/NrOQTHN.png)

- Projects can belong to a folder, which is another grouping mechanism.
- use folders to reflect their hierarchy of the enterprise and apply policies at the right levels within the enterprise.
- can nest folders inside of folder

---

#### Project

- the base level organizing entity for
  - creating and using resources and services, and managing billing APIs, and permissions.

- The GCP resources must belong to a project.

- Projects can be easily created, managed, deleted, or even recovered from accidental deletions.

- labels are changeable, project ID and project number remain fixed.
  - unique project ID and project number.
  - can name the project and apply labels for filtering.

## IAM

IAM allows administrators to define `who can do what` and `on which resources` within an organization.

IAM policies consist of a "who" (principal) and a "can do what" (role).

![Screen Shot 2021-06-28 at 10.44.10 PM](https://i.imgur.com/EQVhpPQ.png)

---

### IAM principle

- The "who"
  - can be a Google account, a Google group, a service account, or a Cloud Identity domain.
  - email address

---

### IAM Roles

- The "What"
  - IAM roles are collections of permissions that are granted to principals.
  - Roles can be basic, predefined, or custom.

3 types of IAM roles

![Screen Shot 2021-02-03 at 15.25.44](https://i.imgur.com/3pIlSRt.png)

**Basic role**
- apply across all GCP services in a project
- affect all resources in a GCP project.
- Basic roles include owner, editor, viewer, and billing administrator.

- ![Screenshot 2024-08-07 at 10.33.24](/assets/img/Screenshot%202024-08-07%20at%2010.33.24.png)
- May too sensitive to apply


**Predefined role**

- apply access to particular GCP services in a project
- specific to Google Cloud services and define where they can be applied.

**custom role**
- define a precise set of permissions
- custom roles can only be applied to <font color=OrangeRed> either the project level or organization level </font>.
- <font color=OrangeRed> canâ€™t be applied to the folder level </font>.

---

#### IAM policy

- IAM policies can include deny rules to restrict certain principals from using certain permissions.

- Deny policies are checked before allow policies.

---

## member

![Screen Shot 2021-06-28 at 10.53.49 PM](https://i.imgur.com/cRKhnOk.png)

- Google account,
- service account,
- Google Group,
- Cloud Identity or google wokrspace domain

---

### Service account

![Screenshot 2024-08-07 at 10.37.40](/assets/img/Screenshot%202024-08-07%20at%2010.37.40.png)

![Screenshot 2024-08-07 at 10.38.35](/assets/img/Screenshot%202024-08-07%20at%2010.38.35.png)

- a special type of Google account
- belongs to an application or a VM, instead of to an individual end user.
- to restrict the actions a resource (such as a VM) can perform
- to allow users to act with service account permissions
- Authentication between Google Cloud Platform services

## Access

### Cloud Identity

![Screenshot 2024-08-07 at 10.39.58](/assets/img/Screenshot%202024-08-07%20at%2010.39.58.png)

![Screenshot 2024-08-07 at 10.41.10](/assets/img/Screenshot%202024-08-07%20at%2010.41.10.png)

a solution for managing users and groups in Google Cloud.

- Admins can log in and manage Google Cloud resources using the same usernames and passwords used in existing Active Directory or LDAP systems.

- Cloud Identity offers a free edition and a premium edition with additional capabilities for managing mobile devices.

- When someone leaves an organization, an administrator can use the Google Admin Console to disable their account and remove them from groups.

- Google Workspace customers already have access to this functionality in the Google Admin Console.
