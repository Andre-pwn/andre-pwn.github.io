### IaaS vs PaaS vs Serverless vs SaaS

- Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
  - delivers on-demand infrastructure resources such as compute, storage, and network capabilities, organized virtually into resources similar to physical data centers.
  - Compute Engine

- Platform as a service (PaaS)
  - offerings bind code to libraries that provide access to the infrastructure application needs.
  - This allows more resources to be focused on application logic.
  - App Engine

- Serverless
  - further eliminate the need for infrastructure management by allowing developers to concentrate on their code.
  - Cloud Functions and Cloud Run,

- Software as a Service (SaaS)
  - provides the entire application stack as a cloud-based service that customers can access and use over the internet.
  - Gmail, Docs, and Drive in Google Workspace.

### security

![Screen Shot 2021-02-03 at 15.07.14](https://i.imgur.com/UEaBU7M.png)

The security infrastructure of Google Cloud and Google services is designed with multiple layers of protection.

![Screenshot 2024-08-07 at 10.06.28](/assets/img/Screenshot%202024-08-07%20at%2010.06.28.png)

- The Hardware infrastructure layer

  - custom-designed server boards and networking equipment.

  - Google uses a secure boot stack to ensure that server machines are booting the correct software stack.

  - Premises security is implemented in Google's data centers, with limited access for Google employees.

![Screenshot 2024-08-07 at 10.06.57](/assets/img/Screenshot%202024-08-07%20at%2010.06.57.png)

- The Service deployment layer focuses on encryption of inter-service communication.

![Screenshot 2024-08-07 at 10.07.24](/assets/img/Screenshot%202024-08-07%20at%2010.07.24.png)

- Google's central identity service
  - goes beyond username and password, employing additional risk-based challenges and secondary factors for user authentication.
  - The service also intelligently challenges users for additional information based on `risk factors` such as whether they have logged in from the same device or a similar location in the past.
  - Users can also employ secondary factors when signing in, including devices based on the Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) open standard.


![Screenshot 2024-08-07 at 10.08.22](/assets/img/Screenshot%202024-08-07%20at%2010.08.22.png)

- Encryption at rest
  - applied to storage services, with centrally managed keys and hardware encryption support.

![Screenshot 2024-08-07 at 10.09.12](/assets/img/Screenshot%202024-08-07%20at%2010.09.12.png)

- The Internet communication layer
  - Google services that are being made available on the internet, register themselves with an infrastructure service called the `Google Front End`,
    - ensures that all TLS connections are ended using a public-private key pair and an X.509 certificate from a Certified Authority (CA),
    - following best practices such as supporting perfect forward secrecy.
  - The GFE additionally applies protections against Denial of Service attacks.

![Screenshot 2024-08-07 at 10.11.34](/assets/img/Screenshot%202024-08-07%20at%2010.11.34.png)

- Google's Operational security layer
  - includes intrusion detection, insider risk reduction, employee U2F use, and stringent software development practices.
  - Google also runs a Vulnerability Rewards Program to incentivize bug discovery in their infrastructure and applications.

### The Google Cloud network

caching nodes:
- Google Cloud has more than 100 content caching nodes worldwide, which cache high demand content for quicker access.

- These caching nodes allow applications to respond to user requests from the location that will provide the quickest response time.


Geographic locations:
- Google Cloud's infrastructure is based in five major geographic locations: North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.

- Each location is divided into several different regions and zones.

  - Google Cloud currently supports 121 zones in 40 regions, with the number increasing over time.

  - ![Screenshot 2024-08-07 at 09.59.45](/assets/img/Screenshot%202024-08-07%20at%2009.59.45.png)

- Regions represent independent geographic areas and are composed of zones.

  - ![Screenshot 2024-08-07 at 10.00.05](/assets/img/Screenshot%202024-08-07%20at%2010.00.05.png)

- Zones are areas where Google Cloud resources are deployed.

- Running resources in different regions and Zones is useful for bringing applications closer to users around the world and for protection in case of issues with an entire region.

  - Some of Google Cloud's services support placing resources in a multi-region, which allows for replication of data in multiple zones across multiple regions.

### Environmental impact

- Google's data centers were the first to achieve ISO 14001 certification, which focuses on enhancing environmental performance and resource efficiency.

- The data center in Hamina, Finland is one of the most advanced and efficient in Google's fleet.

- Google aims to operate completely carbon-free by 2030.

## Interact with Google Cloud

![Screenshot 2024-08-07 at 10.42.12](/assets/img/Screenshot%202024-08-07%20at%2010.42.12.png)

![Screen Shot 2021-02-03 at 15.29.56](https://i.imgur.com/VPu8vIk.png)

4 ways to interact with Google Cloud

- Google Cloud Console
  - web user interface
  - ![Screen Shot 2021-02-10 at 22.01.19](https://i.imgur.com/hONolff.png)

- Cloud SDK and Cloud Shell
  - command-line interface
    - `gcloud`: Compute Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and many Google Cloud services
    - `gsutil`: Cloud Storage
    - `kubectl`: GKE and Kubernetes
    - `bq`: BigQuery
  - Cloud Shell
    - command-line access to cloud resources directly from browser.
      - Web preview functionality
    - Cloud SDK command-line tools always available, up to date, and fully authenticated.
      * Preinstalled Cloud SDK and other tools
    - ephemeral compute engine virtual machine instance
    - built-in authorization for access to Cloud Console project and resource
    - Temporary Compute Engine VM
      - 5 GB of persistent disk storage (`$HOME dir`)
    - Language support for Java, Go, Python, Node.js, PHP, and Ruby
  - After 1 hour of inactivity, the Cloud Shell instance is recycled.
    - Only the `/home` directory persists.
    - Any changes made to the system configuration, including environment variables, are lost between sessions.

- Cloud Console mobile app
  - For iOS and Android

- REST-based API
  - for custom application


> creating environment variables is a good practice. You can easily and consistently re-use these environment variables, which makes your work less error-prone.

## API

![Screen Shot 2021-02-09 at 00.38.36](https://i.imgur.com/Z0xoKOL.png)

Application Programming Interfaces, APIs
- A software services implementation can be complex and changeable.
- to use that service
  - instead other pieces of software had to know internal details about how they worked
  - application developers structure the software, so that it presents a clean, well-defined interface that abstracts away needless details and then they document that interface.
  - That's an API.
- The underlying implementation can change as long as the interface doesn't
  - and other pieces of software that use the API don't have to know or care.
  - to change an API (add or deprecate a feature)
    - version the APIs.
      - To make the API change cleanly
      - API v2 might contain calls that v1 does not.
    - Programs that consume the API can specify the API version that they want to use in their calls.

- Supporting API, Google Cloud platform provides two API management tools.
  - Cloud Endpoints
  - Apigee Edge

---


### Cloud Endpoints
- Suppose
  - you're developing a software service and one of GCP's backends.
  - to make it easy to expose this API.
  - an easy way to monitor and log its use.

- to create and maintain APIs
  - an easy to deploy proxy in front of the software service

- Distributed API management through an API console
  - provides an API console
  - implements those capabilities in an easy-to-manage interface.

- expose the API using a RESTful interface

- <font color=OrangeRed> supports applications running in GCP's compute platforms </font> in the languages and the client technologies.
  - Runtime environment
    - App Engine Flexible environment
    - Kubernetes Engine
    - Compute Engine
  - Clients
    - Android
    - iOS
    - Javascript
- control access and validate calls with JSON Web Tokens and Google API keys
  - identify web, mobile users with Auth0 and Firebase Authentication
  - to make sure it's only consumed by other developers whom you trust.
  - for the API to have a single coherent way for it to know which end user is making the call.
- generate client libraries


---

### Apigee Edge
- a platform
  - for developing and managing API proxies.
  - for making APIs available to the customers and partners
- It has a different orientation though.
- Contains analytics, monetization, and a developer portal
- focus on business problems
  - like rate limiting, quotas, and analytics.
- <font color=OrangeRed> Many users of Apigee Edge are providing a software service to other companies </font> and those features come in handy.
  - do business analytics and billing on a customer-facing API
- Because of the backend services for Apigee Edge need not be in GCP
  - engineers often use it when they are "taking apart" a legacy application.
  - Instead of replacing a monolithic application in one risky move
    - they use Apigee Edge to peel off its services one by one,
    - standing up microservices to implement each in turn,
    - until the legacy application can be finally retired.
