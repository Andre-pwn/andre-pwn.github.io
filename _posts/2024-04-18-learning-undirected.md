A x-post from my contribution to [pgmpy](https://github.com/pgmpy/pgmpy/tree/dev), a library for probabilistic graphical models in python. You can find the original tutorial [here](https://github.com/pgmpy/pgmpy/blob/dev/examples/Learning%20Parameters%20in%20Discrete%20Factor%20Graphs.ipynb), `MirrorDescentEstimator` [here](https://github.com/pgmpy/pgmpy/blob/dev/pgmpy/estimators/MirrorDescentEstimator.py) and `MaximumLikelihoodEstimator` [here](https://github.com/pgmpy/pgmpy/blob/dev/pgmpy/estimators/MLE.py).
