## Lambda sample

### basic

```py
import json, urllib, boto3, csv

# Connect to S3
s3 = boto3.resource('s3')


# Connect to SNS
sns = boto3.client('sns')
alertTopic = 'HighBalanceAlert'



# Connect to DynamoDB
dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')
customerTable     = dynamodb.Table('Customer');
transactionsTable = dynamodb.Table('Transactions');



# Connect to EC2
ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')
# Add a tag to the EC2 instance: Key = Snapshots, Value = Created
    ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
    response = ec2.create_tags(
        Resources=[ec2InstanceId],
        Tags=[{'Key': 'Snapshots', 'Value': 'Created'}]
    )
    print ("***Tag added to EC2 instance with id: " + ec2InstanceId)
```

### S3 triggered, Loops and inserts data into DynamoDB tables

1. Examine the code. It performs the following steps:
     - Downloads the file from Amazon S3 that triggered the event
     - Loops through each line in the file
     - Inserts the data into the Customer and Transactions DynamoDB tables

```py
# TransactionProcessor Lambda function
# This function is triggered by an object being created in an Amazon S3 bucket.
# The file is downloaded and each line is inserted into DynamoDB tables.

from __future__ import print_function
import json, urllib, boto3, csv

# Connect to S3 and DynamoDB
s3 = boto3.resource('s3')
dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')

# Connect to the DynamoDB tables
customerTable     = dynamodb.Table('Customer');
transactionsTable = dynamodb.Table('Transactions');

# This handler is executed every time the Lambda function is triggered
def lambda_handler(event, context):

  # Show the incoming event in the debug log
  print("Event received by Lambda function: " + json.dumps(event, indent=2))

  # Get the bucket and object key from the Event
  bucket = event['Records'][0]['s3']['bucket']['name']
  key = urllib.unquote_plus(event['Records'][0]['s3']['object']['key']).decode('utf8')
  localFilename = '/tmp/transactions.txt'

  # Download the file from S3 to the local filesystem
  try:
    s3.meta.client.download_file(bucket, key, localFilename)
  except Exception as e:
    print(e)
    print('Error getting object {} from bucket {}. Make sure they exist and your bucket is in the same region as this function.'.format(key, bucket))
    raise e

  # Read the Transactions CSV file. Delimiter is the '|' character
  with open(localFilename) as csvfile:
    reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile, delimiter='|')

    # Read each row in the file
    rowCount = 0
    for row in reader:
      rowCount += 1

      # Show the row in the debug log
      print(row['customer_id'], row['customer_address'], row['trn_id'], row['trn_date'], row['trn_amount'])

      try:
        # Insert Customer ID and Address into Customer DynamoDB table
        customerTable.put_item(
          Item={
            'CustomerId': row['customer_id'],
            'Address':  row['customer_address']})

        # Insert transaction details into Transactions DynamoDB table
        transactionsTable.put_item(
          Item={
            'CustomerId':    row['customer_id'],
            'TransactionId':   row['trn_id'],
            'TransactionDate':  row['trn_date'],
            'TransactionAmount': int(row['trn_amount'])})

      except Exception as e:
         print(e)
         print("Unable to insert data into DynamoDB table".format(e))

    # Finished!
    return "%d transactions inserted" % rowCount
```

### function to calculate and send Simple Notification Service notification


```py
# TotalNotifier Lambda function
#
# This function is triggered when values are inserted into the Transactions DynamoDB table.
# Transaction totals are calculated and notifications are sent to SNS if limits are exceeded.

from __future__ import print_function
import json, boto3

# Connect to SNS
sns = boto3.client('sns')
alertTopic = 'HighBalanceAlert'
snsTopicArn = [t['TopicArn'] for t in sns.list_topics()['Topics'] if t['TopicArn'].endswith(':' + alertTopic)][0]

# Connect to DynamoDB
dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')
transactionTotalTableName = 'TransactionTotal'
transactionsTotalTable = dynamodb.Table(transactionTotalTableName);

# This handler is executed every time the Lambda function is triggered
def lambda_handler(event, context):

  # Show the incoming event in the debug log
  print("Event received by Lambda function: " + json.dumps(event, indent=2))

  # For each transaction added, calculate the new Transactions Total
  for record in event['Records']:
    customerId = record['dynamodb']['NewImage']['CustomerId']['S']
    transactionAmount = int(record['dynamodb']['NewImage']['TransactionAmount']['N'])

    # Update the customer's total in the TransactionTotal DynamoDB table
    response = transactionsTotalTable.update_item(
      Key={
        'CustomerId': customerId
      },
      UpdateExpression="add accountBalance :val",
      ExpressionAttributeValues={
        ':val': transactionAmount
      },
      ReturnValues="UPDATED_NEW"
    )

    # Retrieve the latest account balance
    latestAccountBalance = response['Attributes']['accountBalance']
    print("Latest account balance: " + format(latestAccountBalance))

    # If balance > $1500, send a message to SNS
    if latestAccountBalance >= 1500:

      # Construct message to be sent
      message = '{"customerID": "' + customerId + '", ' + '"accountBalance": "' + str(latestAccountBalance) + '"}'
      print(message)

      # Send message to SNS
      sns.publish(
        TopicArn=snsTopicArn,
        Message=message,
        Subject='Warning! Account balance is very high',
        MessageStructure='raw'
      )

  # Finished!
  return 'Successfully processed {} records.'.format(len(event['Records']))
```

## the Different Ways to Invoke Lambda Functions

https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/understanding-the-different-ways-to-invoke-lambda-functions/

![Screen-Shot-2019-06-27-at-2.23.51-PM-1024x510](https://i.imgur.com/AoCgNOQ.png)


### Synchronous Invokes

- the most straight forward way to invoke the Lambda functions.
- the functions execute immediately when perform the Lambda Invoke API call.
- This can be accomplished through a variety of options, including using the CLI or any of the supported SDKs.

exampl:

synchronous invoke using the CLI:

```bash
aws lambda invoke \
    —function-name MyLambdaFunction \
    —invocation-type RequestResponse \
    —payload  “[JSON string here]”
```

> The Invocation-type flag specifies a value of “RequestResponse”.
> This instructs AWS to execute the Lambda function and wait for the function to complete.

- When perform a synchronous invoke, you are responsible for checking the response and determining if there was an error and if you should retry the invoke.

list of services that invoke Lambda functions synchronously:
- Elastic Load Balancing (Application Load Balancer)
- Amazon Cognito
- Amazon Lex
- Amazon Alexa
- Amazon API Gateway
- Amazon CloudFront (Lambda@Edge)
- Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose



### Asynchronous Invokes

Here is an example of an asynchronous invoke using the CLI:

```bash
aws lambda invoke \
    —function-name MyLambdaFunction \
    —invocation-type Event \
    —payload  “[JSON string here]”
```

> Notice, the Invocation-type flag specifies “Event.” If the function returns an error, AWS will automatically retry the invoke twice, for a total of three invocations.

Here is a list of services that invoke Lambda functions asynchronously:
- Amazon S3
- Amazon SNS
- Amazon Simple Email Service
- AWS CloudFormation
- Amazon CloudWatch Logs
- Amazon CloudWatch Events
- AWS CodeCommit
- AWS Config

- Asynchronous invokes place the invoke request in Lambda service queue and we process the requests as they arrive. You should use AWS X-Ray to review how long the request spent in the service queue by checking the “dwell time” segment.



### Poll-Based Invokes
- This invocation model is designed to allow you to integrate with AWS Stream and Queue based services with no code or server management.
- Lambda will poll the following services on the behalf, retrieve records, and invoke the functions.

The following are supported services:
- Amazon Kinesis
- Amazon SQS
- Amazon DynamoDB Streams


- AWS will manage the poller on the behalf and perform Synchronous invokes of the function with this type of integration.
- The retry behavior for this model is based on data expiration in the data source.
- For example, Kinesis Data streams store records for 24 hours by default (up to 168 hours). The specific details of each integration are linked above.
