### Reservations
- services can reserve include: EC2, ElastiCache, DynamoDB, RDS, and RedShift.


### Backup
- Amazon RDS
  - Default automated backups, point in time recovery to any point within the retention period down to a second.
  - full daily snapshot of data (during preferred backup window) and captures transaction logs (updates to DB Instance are made).
  - data is stored on S3 and is equal to the size of the DB

- Amazon LightSail Databases
  - automatically backs up the database and allows point in time restore from the past 7 days using the database restore tool

- EBS:
  - Each EBS volume is automatically replicated within its Availability Zone
  - back up data on EBS volumes to S3 by taking point-in-time snapshots. incremental backups

- EC2:
  - EC2 instances using EBS volumes can be backed up by creating a snapshot of the EBS volume.



### Scaling

- RDS
  - can only scale up (compute and storage), `no decrease`, scale vertically, have downtime.
  - push of a button.
  - Automatic failover for Multi-AZ option: creates a replica in another AZ and synchronously replicates to it (DR only). IOPS storage
  - enable Auto Scaling in AWS Management Console

- DynamoDB
  - default `automatic scaling`
  - Application auto scaling, replicated across 3 AZs in a region.
  - Push button scaling: can scale the DB at any time without downtime.

## AWS solutions

AWS solutions typically fall into one of two categories: unmanaged or managed.

![Screenshot 2023-10-01 at 21.10.54](/assets/img/post/Screenshot%202023-10-01%20at%2021.10.54.png)

### Unmanaged services

- provisioned in discrete portions as specified by the user.
- `require the user to manage` how the service responds to changes in load, errors, and situations where resources become unavailable.

- When you run the own relational database, you are responsible for
  - several administrative tasks (server maintenance and energy footprint, software, installation and patching, and database backups),
  - ensuring high availability,
  - planning for scalability,
  - data security,
  - and OS nstallation and patching.

### Managed services

- require the user to configure them.
- Managed services still require the user to configure them (for example, creating an Amazon S3 bucket and setting permissions for it);
- however, managed services typically require far less configuration.
- The benefit to using an unmanaged service is that to have more fine tuned control over how the solution handles changes in load, errors, and situations where resources become unavailable

For instance
- launch a web server on an Amazon EC2 instance
  - that web server will not scale to handle increased traffic load or replace unhealthy instances with healthy ones unless you specify it to use a scaling solution such as Auto Scaling, because Amazon EC2 is an "unmanaged" solution.
- have a static website hosting in a cloud based storage solution like Amazon S3 without a web server
  - those features (scaling, fault tolerance, and availability) would be automatically handled internally by Amazon S3, because it is a managed solution.

## Cloud deployment models

3 main cloud deployment models
- represent the cloud environments that the applications can be deployed in

### All in Cloud
- A cloud-based application is fully deployed in the cloud, and all parts of the application run in the cloud.
- Applications can either been created in the cloud or migrated from an existing infrastructure.
- Cloud-based applications can be built on low-level infrastructure pieces or they can use higher-level services that provide abstraction from the management, architecting, and scaling requirements of core infrastructure.

### Hybrid
- A hybrid deployment is a way to connect infrastructure/applications between `cloud-based resources and existing resources not in cloud.`
- The most common method of hybrid deployment is between the cloud and existing on-premises infrastructure.
- This model enables an organization to `extend and grow the infrastructure into the cloud while connecting cloud resources to internal systems`.

### Private / on-premises
- Deploying resources on-premises,
- using virtualization and resource management tools
- does not provide many of the benefits of cloud computing, it is sometimes sought for its ability to provide dedicated resources.
- In most cases, this deployment model is the same as legacy IT infrastructure, but it might also use application management and virtualization technologies to increase resource utilization.

## Advantages of cloud computing

![Screenshot 2023-10-01 at 21.20.41](/assets/img/post/Screenshot%202023-10-01%20at%2021.20.41.png)

1. Trade `capital expense` for `variable expense`:
   - **Capital expenses (capex)**: funds that a company uses to acquire, upgrade, and maintain physical assets such as property, industrial buildings, or equipment.
   - **variable expense (oppex)**: expense that the person who bears the cost can easily alter or avoid.
   - Maintenance is reduced
   - Cost savings

2. Benefit from massive economies of scale:
   - a lower variable cost than you can get on the own.
   - as AWS can achieve higher economies of scale, lower pay-as-you-go prices.

3. Stop guessing capacity:
   - Eliminate guessing infrastructure capacity needs. When you make a capacity decision before you deploy an application, expensive idle resources / limited capacity. With cloud computing, these problems go away. You can access as much or as little as you need, and scale up and down as required with only a few minutes’ notice.
   - `Elasticity` 弹力
     - avoid over-provision resources up front to handle peak levels of activity
     - scale resources up or down to instantly to grow and shrink capacity as the business needs change.

4. `Increase speed and agility 敏捷`:
   - new IT resources with a click, reduce the time to make those resources available.
     - dramatic increase agility for the organization because the cost and time that it takes to experiment and develop are significantly lower.
   - easy access to a broad range of technologies to innovate faster and build nearly anything.
     - quickly spin up resources as needed from infrastructure services, such as compute, storage, and databases, to IoT, machine learning, data lakes and analytics...
     - deploy technology services in minutes, and get from idea to implementation several orders of magnitude faster than before.
     - the freedom to experiment, test new ideas to differentiate customer experiences, and transform the business.

5. Stop spending money in `data centers`:
   - Stop spending money on running and maintaining
   - Focus on projects that differentiate the business instead of focusing on the infrastructure.

6. Go `global in minutes`:
   - deploy the application in multiple AWS Regions around the world with just a few clicks.
   - provide a lower latency and better experience for the customers simply and at minimal cost.
   - For example,
   - AWS has infrastructure all over the world, so you can deploy the application in multiple physical locations with just a few clicks.
   - Put applications closer to end users reduces latency and improves their experience.
