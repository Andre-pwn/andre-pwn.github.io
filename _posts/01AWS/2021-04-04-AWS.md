## AWS solutions

AWS solutions typically fall into one of two categories: unmanaged or managed.

![Screenshot 2023-10-01 at 21.10.54](/assets/img/post/Screenshot%202023-10-01%20at%2021.10.54.png)

### Unmanaged services

- provisioned in discrete portions as specified by the user.
- `require the user to manage` how the service responds to changes in load, errors, and situations where resources become unavailable.

- When you run the own relational database, you are responsible for
  - several administrative tasks (server maintenance and energy footprint, software, installation and patching, and database backups),
  - ensuring high availability,
  - planning for scalability,
  - data security,
  - and OS nstallation and patching.

### Managed services

- require the user to configure them.
- Managed services still require the user to configure them (for example, creating an Amazon S3 bucket and setting permissions for it);
- however, managed services typically require far less configuration.
- The benefit to using an unmanaged service is that to have more fine tuned control over how the solution handles changes in load, errors, and situations where resources become unavailable

For instance
- launch a web server on an Amazon EC2 instance
  - that web server will not scale to handle increased traffic load or replace unhealthy instances with healthy ones unless you specify it to use a scaling solution such as Auto Scaling, because Amazon EC2 is an "unmanaged" solution.
- have a static website hosting in a cloud based storage solution like Amazon S3 without a web server
  - those features (scaling, fault tolerance, and availability) would be automatically handled internally by Amazon S3, because it is a managed solution.

## Cloud deployment models

3 main cloud deployment models
- represent the cloud environments that the applications can be deployed in

### All in Cloud
- A cloud-based application is fully deployed in the cloud, and all parts of the application run in the cloud.
- Applications can either been created in the cloud or migrated from an existing infrastructure.
- Cloud-based applications can be built on low-level infrastructure pieces or they can use higher-level services that provide abstraction from the management, architecting, and scaling requirements of core infrastructure.

### Hybrid
- A hybrid deployment is a way to connect infrastructure/applications between `cloud-based resources and existing resources not in cloud.`
- The most common method of hybrid deployment is between the cloud and existing on-premises infrastructure.
- This model enables an organization to `extend and grow the infrastructure into the cloud while connecting cloud resources to internal systems`.

### Private / on-premises
- Deploying resources on-premises,
- using virtualization and resource management tools
- does not provide many of the benefits of cloud computing, it is sometimes sought for its ability to provide dedicated resources.
- In most cases, this deployment model is the same as legacy IT infrastructure, but it might also use application management and virtualization technologies to increase resource utilization.

## Advantages of cloud computing

![Screenshot 2023-10-01 at 21.20.41](/assets/img/post/Screenshot%202023-10-01%20at%2021.20.41.png)

1. Trade `capital expense` for `variable expense`:
   - **Capital expenses (capex)**: funds that a company uses to acquire, upgrade, and maintain physical assets such as property, industrial buildings, or equipment.
   - **variable expense (oppex)**: expense that the person who bears the cost can easily alter or avoid.
   - Maintenance is reduced
   - Cost savings

2. Benefit from massive economies of scale:
   - a lower variable cost than you can get on the own.
   - as AWS can achieve higher economies of scale, lower pay-as-you-go prices.

3. Stop guessing capacity:
   - Eliminate guessing infrastructure capacity needs. When you make a capacity decision before you deploy an application, expensive idle resources / limited capacity. With cloud computing, these problems go away. You can access as much or as little as you need, and scale up and down as required with only a few minutes’ notice.
   - `Elasticity` 弹力
     - avoid over-provision resources up front to handle peak levels of activity
     - scale resources up or down to instantly to grow and shrink capacity as the business needs change.

4. `Increase speed and agility 敏捷`:
   - new IT resources with a click, reduce the time to make those resources available.
     - dramatic increase agility for the organization because the cost and time that it takes to experiment and develop are significantly lower.
   - easy access to a broad range of technologies to innovate faster and build nearly anything.
     - quickly spin up resources as needed from infrastructure services, such as compute, storage, and databases, to IoT, machine learning, data lakes and analytics...
     - deploy technology services in minutes, and get from idea to implementation several orders of magnitude faster than before.
     - the freedom to experiment, test new ideas to differentiate customer experiences, and transform the business.

5. Stop spending money in `data centers`:
   - Stop spending money on running and maintaining
   - Focus on projects that differentiate the business instead of focusing on the infrastructure.

6. Go `global in minutes`:
   - deploy the application in multiple AWS Regions around the world with just a few clicks.
   - provide a lower latency and better experience for the customers simply and at minimal cost.
   - For example,
   - AWS has infrastructure all over the world, so you can deploy the application in multiple physical locations with just a few clicks.
   - Put applications closer to end users reduces latency and improves their experience.

## lift and shift example

- rarely do the same parties easily agree on a common approach to the hundreds or thousands of existing applications that still reside in company data centers.

- Teams responsible for effecting an enterprise’s transition to the cloud might initially find it easier to apply a one-size-fits-all approach and cut through devolving debates about risks and dependencies, but that approach could also jeopardize the trust and cooperation of the application owners they are asking to migrate.

- Yet many enterprise cloud teams have been successful earning this trust and cooperation while also

- delivering on aggressive timelines in so-called **“lift-and-shift” cloud migrations**
  - move a specific set of applications to the cloud as fast as possible without changing their core architecture, functionality, or performance characteristics.
  - This is no small challenge since some application development teams will have the opinion that their software will require substantial refactoring to run in the cloud, while others don’t want to bring their technical debt to a pristine new cloud environment.
  - The fundamental notion of software refactoring is to change application code for the better.

### All in Cloud

![Screenshot 2023-10-01 at 21.36.35](/assets/img/post/Screenshot%202023-10-01%20at%2021.36.35.png)

### Hybrid

- havincg data resides both on-premises and in the cloud.

- This is often done to economically store large data sets, utilize new cloud-native databases, move data closer to customers, or to create a backup and archive solution with cost-effective high availability.

- In all cases, AWS offers a range of storage and database services that can work together with your on-premises applications to store data reliably and securely.

￼

Traditional monolithic architectures

- hard to scale.

- As an application's code base grows, it becomes complex to update and maintain. Introducing new features, languages, frameworks, and technologies becomes very hard, limiting innovation and new ideas.

- microservices architecture
  - a design approach to build a single application as a set of small services.
  - Each application component / service runs in its own process and communicates with other services through a well-defined API interface (using a lightweight mechanism, typically an HTTP-based application programming interface (API). )

- Microservices are built around business capabilities
  - each service performs a single function.
  - use different frameworks / programming languages to write microservices and deploy them independently, as a single service, or as a group of services.

- Microservices can be written using different frameworks and programming languages, and you can deploy them independently, as a single service, or as a group of services.

- Microservices allow you to choose the best technology for your workload.

- For example you might use in-memory cache such as Memcached or Redis for fast access to your data, but in another service you might be better served with a traditional relational database. Same goes for your chosen programming language and other technology choices: remaining flexible about them is both a benefit and a mandate.

￼

Agility

- Microservices foster an organization of small, independent teams that take ownership of their services.

- Teams act within a small and well understood context, empowered to work more independently and more quickly.

- This shortens development cycle times.

- You benefit significantly from the aggregate throughput of the organization.

Flexible scaling

- Microservices allow each service to be independently scaled to meet demand for the application feature it supports.

- enables teams to right-size infrastructure needs, accurately measure the cost of a feature, and maintain availability if a service experiences a spike in demand.

Easy deployment

- Microservices enable continuous integration and delivery, easy to try new ideas and roll back if doesn’t work.

- low cost of failure enables experimentation, easier to update code, and accelerates time-to-market for new features.

Technological freedom

- Microservices architectures don’t follow a “one size fits all” approach.

- Teams have the freedom to choose the best tool to solve their specific problems.

- teams building microservices can choose the best tool for each job.

Reusable code

- Dividing software into small, well-defined modules enables teams to use functions for multiple purposes.

- A service written for a certain function can be used as a building block for another feature.

- allows an application to bootstrap off itself, as developers can create new capabilities without writing code from scratch.

Resilience 弹回

- Service independence increases an application’s resistance to failure.

- In a monolithic architecture, if a single component fails, it can cause the entire application to fail.

- With microservices, applications handle total service failure by degrading functionality and not crashing the entire application.


In order to replicate the business domain, integrate the services that you have built. How can you do this in the best possible fashion?

- iterate faster but not break functionality in the process.
  - The interface is crucial. You need to be considerate of other teams that depend on your product.

- make the API as simple as possible.
  - easier to maintain and change later.
  - Because interfacing is so important, choosing a unified solution for all this inter-service communication to occur is tempting.
  - Be careful to avoid integrating with smart, controlling, complex middleware which would force tighter coupling.

- treat the servers as stateless.
  - Servers should be seen as interchangeable members of a group.
  - Focus on determining if you have enough capacity to handle your workload.
  - Keep in mind that adding and removing instances with Auto Scaling is much easier with a stateless approach.


￼
Serverless

- most often refers to serverless applications.

- don't require you to provision or manage any servers.
  - responsibilities like operating system (OS) access control, OS patching, provisioning, right-sizing, scaling, and availability
  - By building your application on a serverless platform, the platform manages these responsibilities for you.

- You can focus on your core product and business logic

￼






similarities between AWS and the traditional, on-premises IT space:

￼


the main Amazon Web Services AWS service categories and core services
web service

- is any piece of software that makes itself available over the internet or on private (intranet) networks.

- uses a standardized format — such as Extensible Markup Language (XML) or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)—for the request and the response of an application programming interface (API) interaction. It is not tied to any one operating system or programming language.It’s self-describing via an interface definition file and it is discoverable.
Amazon Web Services (AWS)

- a secure cloud platform that offers a broad set of global cloud-based products.

- Because these products are delivered over the internet, you have on-demand access to the compute, storage, network, database, and other IT resources and the tools to manage them. You can immediately provision and launch AWS resources. The resources are ready for you to use in minutes.

- AWS offers flexibility. Your AWS environment can be reconfigured and updated on demand, scaled up or down automatically to meet usage patterns and optimize spending, or shut down temporarily or permanently. The billing for AWS services becomes an operational expense instead of a capital expense.

- AWS services are designed to work together to support virtually any type of application or workload. Think of these services like building blocks, which you can assemble quickly to build sophisticated, scalable solutions, and then adjust them as your needs change.

￼

Which service depend on business goals and technology requirements.

- Amazon EC2: complete control over your AWS computing resources.

- AWS Lambda: to run your code and not manage or provision servers.

- AWS Elastic Beanstalk: a service that deploys, manages, and scales your web applications for you.

- Amazon Lightsail: a lightweight cloud platform for a simple web application.

- AWS Batch: need to run hundreds of thousands of batch workloads.

- AWS Outposts: to run AWS infrastructure in your on-premises data center.

- Amazon Elastic Container Service(Amazon ECS), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service(Amazon EKS), or AWS Fargate: to implement a containers or microservices architecture.

- VMware Cloud on AWS: You have an on-premises server virtualization platform that you want to migrate to AWS.

￼


￼

For example

- a database application

- customers might be sending data to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, a service in the compute category.

- These EC2 servers batch the data in one-minute increments and add an object per customer to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), the AWS storage service you’ve chosen to use.

- then use a non relational database like Amazon DynamoDB to power your application, for example, to build an index so that you can find all the objects for a given customer that were collected over a certain period.

- You might run these services inside an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), which is a service in the networking category.
to access the broad array of services offered by AWS.

- AWS Management Console: The console provides a rich graphical interface to a majority of the features offered by AWS.

- AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI):The AWS CLI provides a suite of utilities that can be launched from a command script in Linux, macOS, or Microsoft Windows.

- Software development kits (SDKs): AWS provides packages that enable accessing AWS in a variety of popular programming languages.
All three options are built on a common REST-like API that serves as the foundation of AWS. To learn more about tools you can use to develop and manage applications on AWS,

the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF)
AWS CAF:

- help organizations design and travel an accelerated path to successful cloud adoption.

- provides guidance and best practices to help organizations identify gaps in skills and processes.

- helps organizations build a comprehensive approach to cloud computing—both across the organization and throughout the IT lifecycle—to accelerate successful cloud adoption.
At the highest level, the AWS CAF organizes guidance into six areas of focus/perspectives: Business(business, people, governance), technical (platform, security, operations).

- Each perspective consists of a set of capabilities, which covers distinct responsibilities that are owned or managed by functionally related stakeholders.

- Capabilities within each perspective are used to identify which areas of an organization require attention. By identifying gaps, prescriptive work streams can be created that support a successful cloud journey.
	1.	Stakeholders from the Business perspective

- (business/finance managers, budget owners, and strategy stakeholders)

- can use the AWS CAF to create a strong business case for cloud adoption and prioritize cloud adoption initiatives.

- ensure that business strategies and goals align with its IT strategies and goals.
	2.	Stakeholders from the People perspective

- (human resources, staffing, and people managers: resource/incentive/career/training/organization change management)

- can use the AWS CAF to evaluate organizational structures and roles, new skill and process requirements, and identify gaps.

- Performing an analysis of needs and gaps can help prioritize training, staffing, and organizational changes to build an agile organization.
	3.	Stakeholders from the Governance perspective

- (the Chief Information Officer, CIO, program managers, enterprise architects, business analysts, and portfolio managers: portfolio/program and project/business performance/license management)

- can use the AWS CAF to focus on the skills and processes that are needed to align 使结盟 IT strategy and goals with business strategy and goals.

- This focus helps the organization maximize the business value of its IT investment and minimize the business risks.
	4.	Stakeholders from the Platform perspective

- (Chief Technology Officer, CTO, IT managers, solutions architects: compute/network/storage/database provisioning, systems and solution architecture, application development)

- use a variety of architectural dimensions and models to understand and communicate the nature of IT systems and their relationships.

- They must be able to describe the architecture of the target state environment in detail. The AWS CAF includes principles and patterns for implementing new solutions on the cloud, and for migrating on-premises workloads to the cloud.
	5.	Stakeholders from the Security perspective

- (Chief Information Security Officer, CISO, IT security managers/analysts: identity and access management, detective control, infrastructure security, data protection, incident response)

- must ensure that the organization meets security objectives for visibility, audit ability, control, and agility.

- can use the AWS CAF to structure the selection and implementation of security controls that meet the organization’s needs.
	6.	Stakeholders from the Operations perspective

- (IT operations/support managers: service monitoring, application performance monitoring, resource inventory management, release/change management, reporting and analytics, business continuity/disaster recovery, IT service catalog)

- define how day-to-day, quarter-to-quarter, and year-to-year business is conducted.

- Stakeholders from the Operations perspective align with and support the operations of the business. The AWS CAF helps these stakeholders define current operating procedures.

- It also helps them identify the process changes and training that are needed to implement successful cloud adoption.
