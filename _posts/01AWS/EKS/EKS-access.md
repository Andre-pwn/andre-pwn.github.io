## Kubernetes services

### expose the Kubernetes services


#### `ClusterIP`
- exposes the service on a cluster's internal IP address.
- 默认的ServiceType
- 在集群内部IP上公开服务。
- 选择使服务只能从群集中访问。
- 可以从spec.clusterIp端口访问它。
- 如果设置了`spec.ports [*].targetPort`，它将从端口路由到targetPort。
- 调用 `kubectl get services` 时获得的CLUSTER-IP是内部在集群内分配给此服务的IP。

- ClusterIP services are created by default when you create a service in Kubernetes.
- They have a cluster-internal IP address that is <font color=red> only accessible to other pods in the cluster </font>.
- To access a ClusterIP service from outside the cluster, you would need to use a proxy.

#### `NodePort`
- exposes the service on each node’s IP address at a static port.
- 在每个Node的IP上公开静态端口（NodePort）服务。
- 将自动创建NodePort服务到ClusterIP服务的路由。
- 可以通过请求：来从群集外部请求NodePort服务。
- 如果通过nodePort的方式从节点的外部IP访问此服务，它会将请求路由到`spec.clusterIp:spec.ports[*].port`，然后将其路由到`spec.ports [*].targetPort`，如果设置。也可以使用与ClusterIP相同的方式访问此服务。
- NodeIP是节点的外部IP地址。无法从`:spec.ports [*].nodePort`访问您的服务。

#### `LoadBalancer`
- exposes the service externally using a load balancer.
- 使用云提供商的负载均衡器在外部公开服务。
- 将自动创建外部负载均衡器到NodePort和ClusterIP服务的路由。
- 可以从负载均衡器的IP地址访问此服务，该IP地址将您的请求路由到nodePort，而nodePort又将请求路由到clusterIP端口。可以像访问NodePort或ClusterIP服务一样访问此服务。

- LoadBalancer services are created when you specify the type field in the service definition to be "LoadBalancer".
- They have a public IP address that is accessible from outside the cluster.
- LoadBalancer services are typically created by the cloud provider that you are using for your Kubernetes cluster.

### how to choose

> The main difference between `ClusterIP` and `LoadBalancer` services in Kubernetes is that ClusterIP services are only accessible within the cluster, while LoadBalancer services are accessible from outside the cluster.

Examples of use a **ClusterIP** service:

1. When you are `developing and testing an application`, you might want to use a ClusterIP service so that <font color=blue> you can access the application from other pods in the cluster </font>.

1. When you are `running a service` that is <font color=blue> only intended to be used by other services in the cluster </font>, you might want to use a ClusterIP service.


Examples of use a **LoadBalancer** service:

1. When you are `running a service` that is intended to be <font color=blue> used by users outside the cluster </font>, you might want to use a LoadBalancer service.

1. When you are `running a service` that needs to <font color=blue> be accessible from multiple regions </font>, you might want to use a LoadBalancer service.


ClusterIP services are more secure than LoadBalancer services
- as they are not exposed to the public internet.
- This means that they are less likely to be attacked by malicious actors.
- However, ClusterIP services can only be accessed by other pods that are running in the same cluster. This can be a limitation if you need to access the service from outside the cluster.

LoadBalancer services are less secure than ClusterIP services,
- as they are exposed to the public internet.
- This means that they are more likely to be attacked by malicious actors.
- However, LoadBalancer services can be accessed from anywhere, which can be convenient for users.


### example

```bash
# Create a sample application
cat <<EOF > nginx-deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 2

      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
EOF

# Create the deployment:
kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml

# Verify that the pods are running and have their own internal IP addresses:
kubectl get pods -l 'app=nginx' -o wide | awk {'print $1" " $3 " " $6'} | column -t
# NAME                               STATUS   IP

# nginx-deployment-574b87c764-xsn9s  Running  192.168.53.240
```


1. Create the ClusterIP Service


```bash
# Create a ClusterIP service
cat <<EOF > clusterip.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service-cluster-ip
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
EOF
# create the object and apply the clusterip.yaml file,
kubectl create -f clusterip.yaml
# service/nginx-service-cluster-ip created

or

# To expose a deployment of ClusterIP type, run the following imperative command:
# expose command creates a service without creating a YAML file.
# However, kubectl translates your imperative command into a declarative Kubernetes Deployment object.
kubectl expose deployment nginx-deployment  \
  --type=ClusterIP  \
  --name=nginx-service-cluster-ip
# Output:
# service "nginx-service-cluster-ip" exposed


# Delete the ClusterIP service:
kubectl delete service nginx-service-cluster-ip
# Output:
# service "nginx-service-cluster-ip" deleted


```


2. Create a NodePort service

```bash
# create a NodePort service
cat <<EOF > nodeport.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service-nodeport
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
EOF
# create the object and apply the nodeport.yaml file
kubectl create -f nodeport.yaml

or

# To expose a deployment of NodePort type
kubectl expose deployment nginx-deployment  \
  --type=NodePort  \
  --name=nginx-service-nodeport
# Output:
# service/nginx-service-nodeport exposed




# Get information about nginx-service:
kubectl get service/nginx-service-nodeport
# Output:
# NAME                     TYPE       CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
# nginx-service-nodeport   NodePort   10.100.106.151   <none>        80:30994/TCP   27s

# Important: The ServiceType is a NodePort and ClusterIP that are created automatically for the service.
# The output from the preceding command shows that the NodePort service is exposed externally on the port (30994) of the available worker node's EC2 instance.
# Before you access NodeIP:NodePort from outside the cluster, you must set the security group of the nodes to allow incoming traffic. You can allow incoming traffic through the port (30994) that's listed in the output of the preceding kubectl get service command.

4.
# If the node is in a public subnet and is reachable from the internet, check the node’s public IP address:
kubectl get nodes -o wide |  awk {'print $1" " $2 " " $7'} | column -t

```






## Aceess

User accounts versus service accounts
- user
  - User accounts are for humans.
  - Service accounts are for processes, which run in pods.
- name
  - User accounts are intended to be global. Names must be unique across all namespaces of a cluster.
  - Service accounts are namespaced.
- permission
  - Typically, a cluster's user accounts might be synced from a corporate database, where new user account creation requires special privileges and is tied to complex business processes.
  - Service account creation is intended to be more lightweight, allowing cluster users to create service accounts for specific tasks by following the principle of least privilege.
- Auditing considerations for humans and service accounts may differ.
- A config bundle for a complex system may include definition of various service accounts for components of that system. Because service accounts can be created without many constraints and have namespaced names, such config is portable.













## use case

### Enabling cross-account access to EKS cluster resources

Often customers manage their AWS environments separated using multiple AWS accounts.
- They do not want production resources to interact or coexist with development or staging resources.
- While this provides the benefits of better resource isolation, it increases the access management overhead.

access
- User access to multiple accounts can be managed by leveraging temporary AWS security credentials using `AWS Security Token Service (STS) and IAM roles`.
- But what if the resources, say, containerized workloads or pods in an EKS cluster hosted in one account wants to interact with the EKS cluster resources hosted in another account?
  - use fine-grained roles at the pod level using `IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA)`.

---

**Scenario**

- a customer with multiple accounts – dev, stg, and prod
- wants to manage the resources from a continuous integration (CI) account.
- An EKS cluster in this CI account needs to access AWS resources to these target accounts.
- One simple way to `grant access to the pods in the CI account` to target cross-account resources:
  - Create roles in these target accounts
  - Grant assume role permissions to the CI account EKS cluster node instance profile on the target account roles
  - And finally, trust this cluster node instance profile in the target account’s role(s)


Though this will allow the EKS cluster in the CI account to communicate with the AWS resources in the target accounts, it grants **any pod running on this node** access to this role.
- At AWS, we always insist to follow the standard security advice of granting least privilege, or granting only the permissions required to perform a task. Start with a minimum set of permissions and grant additional permissions as necessary.

---

**Solution**

![Screen Shot 2022-10-19 at 11.58.46](https://i.imgur.com/Hqu1Por.png)

IAM supports federated users using **OpenID Connect (OIDC)**.
- Amazon EKS hosts a `public OIDC discovery endpoint` per **cluster** containing the **signing keys** for the `ProjectedServiceAccountToken` JSON web tokens
- so external systems, like IAM, can validate and accept the OIDC tokens issued by Kubernetes.


---

#### Prerequisites

- OIDC
- IAM role + IAM policy
- Kubenert service account -> IAM role


##### Setup OIDC in CI account

1. Fetch the CI account cluster’s OIDC issuer URL
   1. for EKS cluster version is 1.13+, it will have an OpenID Connect issuer URL.
   2. get this URL from the Amazon EKS console directly, or use CLI command to retrieve it.

```bash
aws eks describe-cluster \
    --name <CI_EKS_CLUSTER_NAME> \
    --query "cluster.identity.oidc.issuer" \
    --output text \
    --profile ci-env

# Determine whether you have an existing IAM OIDC provider for the cluster.
oidc_id=$(aws eks describe-cluster \
              --name my-cluster \
              --query "cluster.identity.oidc.issuer" \
              --output text | cut -d '/' -f 5)

# Determine whether an IAM OIDC provider with the cluster's ID is already in the account.
aws iam list-open-id-connect-providers | grep $oidc_id
```


1. Create an OIDC provider for the cluster in the CI account
   1. Navigate to the IAM console in the CI account, choose Identity Providers, and then select Create provider.
   2. Select `OpenID Connect` for provider type and paste the OIDC issuer URL for the cluster for provider URL. Enter `sts.amazonaws.com` for audience as shown below.

```bash
# If no output is returned, then you must create an IAM OIDC provider for the cluster.

# Create an IAM OIDC identity provider for the cluster with the following command. Replace my-cluster with the own value.
eksctl utils associate-iam-oidc-provider \
  --cluster my-cluster \
  --approve
```


##### Setup IAM role in CI account

1. Create IAM policy

```bash
cat >my-policy.json <<EOF
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "config:*",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
EOF

# Create the IAM policy.
aws iam create-policy \
  --policy-name my-policy \
  --policy-document file://my-policy.json
```


1. Create an IAM role
   1. Create an `IAM role` in the CI account, ci-account-iam-role
   2. associate it **IAM policy**

```json
// Create the role.
aws iam create-role \
  --role-name my-role \
  --assume-role-policy-document file://trust-relationship.json \
  --description "my-role-description"

// Attach IAM policy
aws iam attach-role-policy \
  --role-name my-role \
  --policy-arn=arn:aws:iam::$account_id:policy/my-policy
```




1. Once the role is created
   1. associate it with **Kubernetes service account**
   2. attach the IAM policy that you want to associate with the serviceaccount.
   3. the **serviceaccount** must be able to assume role to the target account, so grant the following assume role permissions.
   4. Note that if you haven’t created the target account IAM role, please proceed to step 4 and complete configuring the target AWS account and then finish associating this policy.



```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::TARGET_ACCOUNT_ID:role/target-account-iam-role"
        }
    ]
}
```





##### Setup Kubernetes serviceaccount in CI account


2. Creat the serviceaccount
   1. associate **IAM Role** with **Kubernetes service account**
   2. attach the IAM policy that you want to associate with the serviceaccount.

1. Setup IAM role
   1. associate it with **trust relationship** to the cluster’s OIDC provider
      1. pecify the service-account, namespace to restrict the access.
      2. specifying ci-namespace and ci-serviceaccount for namespace and serviceaccount respectively.
      3. Replace the OIDC_PROVIDER with the provider URL saved in the previous step.



```bash
# Set variables
export cluster_name=dev-my-app-01
export namespace=default
export service_account=my-app
export my_role=eks-my-app
export policy_arn=arn:aws:iam::my_account:policy/my-app-coe-config-policy
# Set AWS account ID
account_id=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query "Account" --output text)
# Set cluster's OIDC identity provider
oidc_provider=$(aws eks describe-cluster \
  --name dev-my-app-01 \
  --query "cluster.identity.oidc.issuer" \
  --output text | sed -e "s/^https:\/\///")

# ============= 1
eksctl create iamserviceaccount \
  --name $service_account \
  --namespace $namespace \
  --cluster $cluster_name \
  --role-name $my_role \
  --attach-policy-arn $policy_arn \
  --approve

# ============= 2
cat >my-service-account.yaml <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: $service_account
  namespace: $namespace
EOF
kubectl apply -f my-service-account.yaml


cat >trust-relationship.json <<EOF
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::$account_id:oidc-provider/$oidc_provider"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "$oidc_provider:aud": "sts.amazonaws.com",
          "$oidc_provider:sub": "system:serviceaccount:$namespace:$service_account"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
EOF
```


1. Configuring the Kubernetes
   1. In Kubernetes, define the IAM role to associate with a service account in the cluster by adding the `eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn` annotation to the service account.
   2. annotate the service account associated with the cluster in the CI account with the role ARN as shown below.


```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: ci-serviceaccount
  namespace: ci-namespace
  annotations:
    eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: arn:aws:iam::CI_ACCOUNT_ID:role/ci-account-iam-role
```
The equivalent kubectl command is:

```bash

# Annotate service account with the IAM role Arn that you want the service account to assume.
# Replace my-role with the name of the existing IAM role.
# Suppose that you allowed a role from a different AWS account than the account that the cluster is in to assume the role.
# Then, make sure to specify the AWS account and role from the other account. For more information, see Cross-account IAM permissions.
$ kubectl annotate serviceaccount \
  -n $namespace $service_account eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn=arn:aws:iam::$account_id:role/my-role
```







##### Confirm the role and service account


```bash
# Confirm that the role and service account are configured correctly.
aws iam get-role \
  --role-name $my_role \
  --query Role.AssumeRolePolicyDocument
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::123:oidc-provider/oidc.eks.region-code.amazonaws.com/id/EXAMPLE"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "oidc.eks.region-code.amazonaws.com/id/EXAMPLE:sub": "system:serviceaccount:default:my-service-account",
                    "oidc.eks.region-code.amazonaws.com/id/EXAMPLE:aud": "sts.amazonaws.com"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

# Confirm the policy is attached to the role.
aws iam list-attached-role-policies \
  --role-name $my_role \
  --query AttachedPolicies[].PolicyArn \
  --output text

# View the default version of the policy.
aws iam get-policy \
  --policy-arn $policy_arn

aws iam get-policy-version \
  --policy-arn $policy_arn \
  --version-id v1

# Confirm that the Kubernetes service account is annotated with the role.
kubectl describe serviceaccount $service_account -n default
# The example output is as follows.
# Name:                my-service-account
# Namespace:           default
# Annotations:         eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/my-role
# Image pull secrets:  <none>
# Mountable secrets:   my-service-account-token-qqjfl
# Tokens:              my-service-account-token-qqjfl
```





##### configure a pod to use a service account



1. create a deployment manifest that you can deploy a pod to confirm configuration with


```bash

# Set variables
export cluster_name=dev-my-app-01
export namespace=default
export service_account=my-app
export my_app=my-app
export my_pod=my-app-5bbf4dd447-rshjm
export my_role=eks-my-app
export policy_arn=arn:aws:iam::my_account:policy/my-app-coe-config-policy
# Set AWS account ID
account_id=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query "Account" --output text)
# Set cluster's OIDC identity provider
oidc_provider=$(aws eks describe-cluster \
  --name dev-my-app-01 \
  --query "cluster.identity.oidc.issuer" \
  --output text | sed -e "s/^https:\/\///")


cat >my-deployment.yaml <<EOF
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: $my_app
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: $my_app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: $my_app
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: $service_account
      containers:
      - name: $my_app
        image: public.ecr.aws/nginx/nginx:1.21
EOF

# Deploy the manifest
kubectl apply -f my-deployment.yaml
```


2. confirm

```bash
# View the pods that were deployed with the deployment in the previous step.
kubectl get pods | grep $my_app
# The example output is as follows.
# $my_pod   1/1     Running   0          3m28s


# View the ARN of the IAM role that the pod is using.
kubectl describe pod $my_pod | grep AWS_ROLE_ARN:
# The example output is as follows.
# AWS_ROLE_ARN:                 arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/my-role
# The role ARN must match the role ARN that you annotated the existing service account with. For more about annotating the service account, see Configuring a Kubernetes service account to assume an IAM role.


# Confirm that the pod has a web identity token file mount.
kubectl describe pod $my_pod | grep AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE:
# The example output is as follows.
AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE:  /var/run/secrets/eks.amazonaws.com/serviceaccount/token


# Confirm that the deployment is using the service account.
kubectl describe deployment $my_app | grep "Service Account"
```

1. Confirm that the pods can interact with the AWS services using the permissions assigned in the IAM policy attached to the role.
   1. When a pod uses AWS credentials from an IAM role that's associated with a service account, the AWS CLI or other SDKs in the containers for that pod use the credentials that are provided by that role. If you don't restrict access to the credentials that are provided to the Amazon EKS node IAM role, the pod still has access to these credentials. For more information, see Restrict access to the instance profile assigned to the worker node.
   2. If the pods can't interact with the services as you expected, complete the following steps to confirm the configured.
      1. Confirm that the pods use an AWS SDK version that supports assuming an IAM role through an OpenID Connect web identity token file. For more information, see Using a supported AWS SDK.
      2. Confirm that the deployment is using the service account.
      3. If the pods still can't access services, review the steps that are described in Configuring a Kubernetes service account to assume an IAM role to confirm that the role and service account are configured properly.



##### Configuring the target account

1. Configuring the target account – IAM role and policy permissions
   1. In target account, create an IAM role named `target-account-iam-role` with a trust relationship that allows AssumeRole permissions to CI account’s IAM role created in the previous step

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::CI_ACCOUNT_ID:role/ci-account-iam-role"
      },
      "Condition": {}
    }
  ]
}
```

1. Configuring the target account – IAM policy
   1. create an IAM policy with the necessary permissions the service account’s pods in CI account cluster would need to manage.
   2. Note that if you haven’t created associated the target policy to the CI account, please do the association before proceeding with the next step.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
                "eks:DescribeCluster",
                "eks:ListClusters"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

1. Verifying the cross-account access to AWS resources
   1. Now that the IAM access roles and policies are configured at both the ends- CI and target accounts, we create a sample Kubernetes pod in the CI cluster and test the cross-account access to AWS resources of the target account.
   2. save the below contents to a file named `awsconfig-configmap.yaml`.

```bash
# This configmap is to set the AWS CLI profiles used in the deployment pod.
[profile ci-env]
role_arn = arn:aws:iam::CI_ACCOUNT_ID:role/ci-account-iam-role
web_identity_token_file = /var/run/secrets/eks.amazonaws.com/serviceaccount/token.

[profile target-env]
role_arn = arn:aws:iam::TARGET_ACCOUNT_ID:role/target-account-iam-role
source_profile = ci-env
role_session_name = xactarget


# Create a Kubernetes configMap resource with the below Kubectl command.aw
kubectl create configmap awsconfig-configmap \
    --from-file=config=awsconfig-configmap.yaml \
    -n ci-namespace



# Let us create another configMap resource to store the installation scripts.
# Name a file named script-configmap.yaml and save the below contents into the file.

#!/bin/bash
apt-get update -y && apt-get install -y python curl wget unzip jq nano -y
curl "https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/awscli-bundle.zip" -o "awscli-bundle.zip"
unzip awscli-bundle.zip
./awscli-bundle/install -i /usr/local/aws -b /usr/local/bin/aws
cp -r aws_config/ ~/.aws/
curl -o kubectl https://amazon-eks.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1.14.6/2019-08-22/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
chmod +x ./kubectl
mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
kubectl version


# Create the second Kubernetes configMap resource with the below kubectl command.
kubectl create configmap script-configmap \
    --from-file=script.sh=script-configmap.yaml \
    -n ci-namespace
```



Now it’s time to create a deployment and test the cross-account access. Create another file named test-deployment.yaml.
- Note to replace the values for namespace and serviceaccount if you specified different values in step 3 while creating the OIDC trust relationship.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    app: test-deployment
  name: test-deployment
  namespace: ci-namespace
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: test-pod
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        app: test-pod
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: ubuntu
        name: ubuntu
        command: ["sleep","10000"]
        volumeMounts:
        - name: test-volume
          mountPath: /aws_config
        - name: script-volume
          mountPath: /scripts
      volumes:
      - name: test-volume
        configMap:
          name: awsconfig-configmap
      - name: script-volume
        configMap:
          name: script-configmap
      serviceAccountName: ci-serviceaccount
```


1. test


```bash
# Apply the pod manifest file to create a test container pod
kubectl apply -f test-deployment.yaml


# Log in to the pod’s bash terminal.
POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pod \
            -l app=test-pod \
            -n ci-namespace \
            -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
kubectl exec $POD_NAME -it -n ci-namespace -- bash


# Execute the script mounted to the pod to install the required binaries and libraries.
sh /scripts/script.sh


# Verify if the pod is able to assume both the ci-env and target-env roles by issuing the below calls.
aws sts get-caller-identity --profile ci-env
aws sts get-caller-identity --profile target-env



# The pod now has basic list permissions on the AWS resources as defined in the previous step.
# Below command should output the list of EKS clusters in the target account.
aws eks list-clusters --region <AWS_REGION> --profile target-env



# You can also run a DescribeCluster command to describe the contents of any cluster.

aws eks describe-cluster \
    --name <TARGET_EKS_CLUSTER_NAME> \
    --region <AWS_REGION> \
    --profile target-env
```




1. Configuring target account’s EKS cluster – Modify the aws-auth configmap

For the CI account cluster pod to access and manage the target cluster’s resources, you must edit the aws-auth configmap of the cluster in the target account by adding the role to the system:masters group. Below is how the configmap should look after the changes.

```yaml
  mapRoles: |
. . .
    - groups:
      - system:masters
      rolearn: arn:aws:iam::TARGET_ACCOUNT_ID:role/target-account-iam-role
      username: test-user
```




1. Test the access to EKS clusters in the target accounts

```bash
# In the pod created from step 5, update the kubeconfig to test the access to the target account’s EKS cluster.
aws eks update-kubeconfig \
    --name <TARGET_EKS_CLUSTER_NAME> \
    --region <AWS_REGION>  \
    --profile target-env



# The pod should now be able to access the target cluster’s kube resources. Verify by issuing some sample kubectl get calls to access the target account’s EKS resources.
kubectl get namespaces

kubectl get pods -n kube-system
```
