# Data Structures - Basic 1 - Priority Queues

---

## Priority Queues


**queue**
- first-in first-out data structure


In practice, there are many applications in which a `queue-like structure` is used to manage objects that must be processed in some way, but `the first-in, first-out policy does not suffice`.
- It is unlikely that the landing decisions are based purely on a FIFO policy.
- ‚Äúfirst come, first serve‚Äù policy might seem reasonable, yet for which other priorities come into play.



**priority queue**

- One important variation of Queue

- a collection of `prioritized elements` that
  - allows `arbitrary element insertion`,
  - and allows `the removal of the element that has first priority`.

- A priority queue acts like a queue that dequeue an item by removing it from the front.
  - However, in a priority queue the `logical order of items` inside a queue is determined by their `priority`.
  - The highest priority items are at the front of the queue and the lowest priority items are at the back.
  - Thus when you enqueue an item on a priority queue, the new item may move all the way to the front.


When an element is added to a priority queue
- the user designates its priority by providing an associated **key**.
- `The element with the minimal key will be the next to be removed` from the queue
  - an element with key 1 will be given priority over an element with key 2
- Although it is quite common for priorities to be expressed numerically, any Java object may be used as a key, as long as there exists means to compare any two instances a and b, in a way that defines a natural order of the keys.
- With such generality, applications may develop their own notion of priority for each element.
  - For example
  - different financial analysts may assign different ratings (i.e., priorities) to a particular asset, such as a share of stock.


Implement a priority queue using `sorting` functions and `lists`.
- However, inserting into a list is `ùëÇ(ùëõ)` and sorting a list is `ùëÇ(ùëõlogùëõ)`
- We can do better.
- The classic way to implement a priority queue is using a data structure called a `binary heap`.
  - A binary heap will allow us both enqueue and dequeue items in `ùëÇ(logùëõ)`.

## ADT: Priority Queue in java

- When an element is added to a priority queue, the user designates its priority by providing an associated key.
- The element with the minimal key will be the next to be removed from the queue (thus, an element with key 1 will be given priority over an element with key 2).
- Although it is quite common for priorities to be expressed numerically, any Java object may be used as a key, as long as there exists means to compare any two instances a and b, in a way that defines a natural order of the keys.
- With such generality, applications may develop their own notion of priority for each element.
  - For example,
  - different financial analysts may assign different ratings (i.e., priorities) to a particular asset,
  - such as a share of stock.


`insert(k, v)`:
- Creates an entry with key k and value v in the priority queue.

`min()`:
- Returns (but does not remove) a priority queue entry (k,v) having minimal key;
- returns null if the priority queue is empty.

`removeMin()`:
- Removes and returns an entry (k,v) having minimal key fromm the priority queue;
- returns null if the priority queue is empty.

`size()`:
- Returns the number of entries in the priority queue.

`isEmpty()`:
- Returns a boolean indicating whether the priority queue is empty.


total order relation
- it satisfies the following properties for any keys k1, k2, and k3:
- **Comparability property**: k1 ‚â§ k2 or k2 ‚â§ k1.
- **Antisymmetric property**: if k1 ‚â§ k2 and k2 ‚â§ k1, then k1 = k2.
- **Transitive property**: if k1 ‚â§ k2 and k2 ‚â§ k3, then k1 ‚â§ k3.


Method | Unsorted List | Sorted List
---|---|---
size | O(1) | O(1)
isEmpty | O(1) | O(1)
insert | O(1) | O(n)
min | O(n) | O(1)
removeMin | O(n) | O(1)
space requirement | O(n) |

## Implementing a Priority Queue



---



### Entry **Interface**




implementing a priority queue
- we must keep track of both `an element and its key`
  - even as entries are relocated within a data structure.
- This is reminiscent of maintain a list of elements with access frequencies.
  - use **Design Pattern: Composite**
  - defining an Item class that paired each element with its associated count in our primary data structure.

  - For priority queues
    - we use composition to `pair a key k and a value v as a single object`.
    - To formalize this, we define the public interface, `Entry`


```java
// ‚àó Interface for a key-value pair. ‚àó/
public interface Entry<K, V> {
    K getKey();
    V getV();
}
```


---

### PriorityQueue **Interface**

use the Entry interface for the priority queue
- This allows us to `return both a key and value as a single object` from methods such as min and removeMin.

define the insert method to return an entry;
- in a more **advanced adaptable priority queue**, that entry can be subsequently updated or removed.

```java
// ‚àó‚àó Interface for the priority queue ADT. ‚àó/
public interface PriorityQueue<K, V> {
    int size();
    boolean isEmpty();
    Entry<K,V> insert(K key, V value) throws IllegalArgumentException;
    Entry<K,V> mim();
    Entry<K,V> removeMim();
}
```


---

### Comparable **Interface**


**Comparing Keys with Total Orders**
- we can allow any type of object to serve as a key
  - but we must be able to compare keys to each other in a meaningful way.
  - More so, the results of the comparisons must not be contradictory.

- For a comparison rule, which we denote by ‚â§, to be self-consistent, it must define a total order relation, which is to say that it satisfies the following properties for any keys k1, k2, and k3:

  - **Comparability property**: k1 ‚â§ k2 or k2 ‚â§ k1.
    - The comparability property states that comparison rule is defined for every pair of keys.
    - Note that this property implies the following one:
      - **Reflexive property**: k ‚â§ k.

  - **Antisymmetric property**: if k1 ‚â§ k2 and k2 ‚â§ k1, then k1 = k2.
  - **Transitive property**: if k1 ‚â§ k2 and k2 ‚â§ k3, then k1 ‚â§ k3.


- A comparison rule, ‚â§, that defines a total order relation will never lead to a contradiction.
- Such a rule defines a linear ordering among a set of keys;
  - hence, if a (finite) set of elements has a total order defined for it, then the notion of a minimal key, kmin, is well defined, as a key in which kmin ‚â§ k, for any other key k in our set.



**The Comparable Interface**
- Java provides two means for defining comparisons between object types.

  1. a class may define what is known as the natural ordering of its instances by formally implementing the `java.lang.Comparable` interface -> method, `compareTo`.
     - The syntax `a.compareTo(b)` must return an integer i with the following meaning:

       - i<0 designates that a<b.

       - i=0 designates that a=b.

- i>0designatesthata>b.
For example, the compareTo method of the String class defines the natural
ordering of strings to be lexicographic, which is a case-sensitive extension of the alphabetic ordering to Unicode.
The Comparator Interface
In some applications, we may want to compare objects according to some notion other than their natural ordering. For example, we might be interested in which of two strings is the shortest, or in defining our own complex rules for judging which of two stocks is more promising. To support generality, Java defines the java.util.Comparator interface. A comparator is an object that is external to the class of the keys it compares. It provides a method with the signature compare(a, b) that returns an integer with similar meaning to the compareTo method described above.

As a concrete example, Code Fragment 9.3 defines a comparator that evaluates strings based on their length (rather than their natural lexicographic order).
public class StringLengthComparator implements Comparator<String> { /‚àó‚àó Compares two strings according to their lengths. ‚àó/
public int compare(String a, String b) {
if (a.length() < b.length()) return ‚àí1;
else if (a.length() == b.length()) return 0; else return 1;
} Code Fragment 9.3: A comparator that evaluates strings based on their lengths. Comparators and the Priority Queue ADT
For a general and reusable form of a priority queue, we allow a user to choose any key type and to send an appropriate comparator instance as a parameter to the priority queue constructor. The priority queue will use that comparator anytime it needs to compare two keys to each other.
For convenience, we also allow a default priority queue to instead rely on the natural ordering for the given keys (assuming those keys come from a comparable class). In that case, we build our own instance of a DefaultComparator class, shown in Code Fragment 9.4.
public class DefaultComparator<E> implements Comparator<E> { public int compare(E a, E b) throws ClassCastException {
return ((Comparable<E>) a).compareTo(b);
5 }Code Fragment 9.4: A DefaultComparator class that implements a comparator
based upon the natural ordering of its element type.

## Binary Heap Â†Ü  


**Heap**
- looks a lot like a tree,
- but we implement it only need a single list as an internal representation.

- The binary heap has two common variations:  
  - min heap, the <font color=red> smallest key is always at the front </font>,
  - max heap, the <font color=red> largest key value is always at the front </font>.


---




### heap implementation

using an `unsorted` list to store entries
- `insertions` in O(1) time,
- but `finding or removing` an element with minimal key requires an O(n)-time loop through the entire collection.

if using a `sorted` list,
- `find or remove` the minimal element in O(1) time,
- but `adding` a new element to the queue may require O(n) time to restore the sorted order.

**binary heap**
- perform both `insertions` and `removals` in logarithmic time,
- which is a significant improvement over the list-based implementations

take advantage of the logarithmic nature of the binary tree
- In order to guarantee logarithmic performance, we must keep our tree balanced.
- A balanced binary tree has roughly the same number of nodes in the left and right subtrees of the root.
- keep the tree balanced by creating a <font color=red> complete binary tree </font>.
  - A complete binary tree is a tree in which each level has all of its nodes.
  - The exception to this is the bottom level of the tree, which we fill in from left to right.  

![heapOrder](https://i.imgur.com/FzGkeOJ.png)

The method to store items in a heap relies on maintaining the **heap order property**.
- The heap order property is as follows:
- In a heap, for every node `ùë•` with parent `ùëù`,
- the key in `ùëù` is smaller than or equal to the key in `ùë•`.
- Figure 2 also illustrates a complete binary tree that has the heap order property.

### min heap in python

- `BinaryHeap()`
  - creates a new, empty, binary heap.
- `insert(k)`
  - adds a new item to the heap.
- `findMin()`
  - returns the item with the minimum key value, leaving item in the heap.
- `delMin()`
  - returns the item with the minimum key value, removing the item from the heap.
- `isEmpty()`
  - returns true if the heap is empty, false otherwise.
- `size()`
  - returns the number of items in the heap.
- `buildHeap(list)`
  - builds a new heap from a list of keys.


```py
from pythonds.trees import BinHeap

class BinHeap:
    def __init__(self):
        self.heapList = [0]
        self.currentSize = 0

    def percUp(self,i):
        while i // 2 > 0:
          if self.heapList[i] < self.heapList[i // 2]:
             tmp = self.heapList[i // 2]
             self.heapList[i // 2] = self.heapList[i]
             self.heapList[i] = tmp
          i = i // 2

    def insert(self,k):
      self.heapList.append(k)
      self.currentSize = self.currentSize + 1
      self.percUp(self.currentSize)

    def percDown(self,i):
      while (i * 2) <= self.currentSize:
          mc = self.minChild(i)
          if self.heapList[i] > self.heapList[mc]:
              tmp = self.heapList[i]
              self.heapList[i] = self.heapList[mc]
              self.heapList[mc] = tmp
          i = mc

    def minChild(self,i):
      if i * 2 + 1 > self.currentSize:
          return i * 2
      else:
          if self.heapList[i*2] < self.heapList[i*2+1]:
              return i * 2
          else:
              return i * 2 + 1

    def delMin(self):
      retval = self.heapList[1]
      self.heapList[1] = self.heapList[self.currentSize]
      self.currentSize = self.currentSize - 1
      self.heapList.pop()
      self.percDown(1)
      return retval

    def buildHeap(self,alist):
      i = len(alist) // 2
      self.currentSize = len(alist)
      self.heapList = [0] + alist[:]
      while (i > 0):
          self.percDown(i)
          i = i - 1

bh = BinHeap()
bh.buildHeap([9,5,6,2,3])

print(bh.delMin())
print(bh.delMin())
print(bh.delMin())
print(bh.delMin())
print(bh.delMin())
```

Notice that no matter the order that we add items to the heap, the smallest is removed each time.

### heap in python

```py
# an empty binary heap has a single zero as the first element of heapList and that this zero is not used, but is there so that simple integer division can be used in later methods.
class BinHeap:
    def __init__(self):
        self.heapList = [0]
        self.currentSize = 0
```


#### `insert`
- most efficient way to add an item to a list is to simply append the item to the end of the list.
- The good news about appending is that it guarantees that we will maintain the complete tree property.
- The bad news about appending is that we will very likely violate the heap structure property.
- However, it is possible to write a method to regain the **heap structure property** by comparing the newly added item with its parent.
  - If the newly added item is less than its parent, then we can swap the item with its parent.  

![percUp](https://i.imgur.com/xWvuclU.png)


when we percolate Êâ©Êï£ an item up
- we are restoring the heap property between the newly added item and the parent.
- We are also preserving the heap property for any siblings.
- Of course, if the newly added item is very small, we may still need to swap it up another level.
- In fact, we may need to keep swapping until we get to the top of the tree.

`percUp`
- percolates a new item as far up in the tree as it needs to go to maintain the heap property.
- Here is where our wasted element in heapList is important.
- Notice that we can compute the parent of any node by using simple integer division.
- The parent of the current node can be computed by dividing the index of the current node by 2.


```py
def percUp(self,i):
    while i // 2 > 0:
      if self.heapList[i] < self.heapList[i // 2]:
         tmp = self.heapList[i // 2]
         self.heapList[i // 2] = self.heapList[i]
         self.heapList[i] = tmp
      i = i // 2

def insert(self,k):
    self.heapList.append(k)
    self.currentSize = self.currentSize + 1
    self.percUp(self.currentSize)
```


#### `delMin`

> to keep complete binary tree, replace the last item with the root

- Since the heap property requires that the root of the tree be the smallest item in the tree, finding the minimum item is easy.
- The hard part of delMin is restoring full compliance with the heap structure and heap order properties after the root has been removed.

restore our heap in two steps.
- First, restore the root item by taking the last item in the list and moving it to the root position.
  - It maintains our heap structure property.
  - But we have probably destroyed the heap order property of our binary heap.
- Second, restore the heap order property by pushing the new root node down the tree to its proper position.  
  - to maintain the heap order property,
  - swap the root with its smallest child less than the root.
  - After the initial swap, we may repeat the swapping process with a `node` and `its children` until the node is swapped into a position on the tree where it is already less than both children.

![percDown](https://i.imgur.com/I1kHltA.png)

```py
def percDown(self,i):
    while (i * 2) <= self.currentSize:
        mc = self.minChild(i)
        if self.heapList[i] > self.heapList[mc]:
            tmp = self.heapList[i]
            self.heapList[i] = self.heapList[mc]
            self.heapList[mc] = tmp
        i = mc

def minChild(self,i):
    if i * 2 + 1 > self.currentSize:
        return i * 2
    # i * 2 + 1 <= self.currentSize
    else:
        if self.heapList[i*2] < self.heapList[i*2+1]:
            return i * 2
        else:
            return i * 2 + 1
```



`delMin`
- the hard work is handled by a helper function, in this case percDown.

```py
def delMin(self):
    retval = self.heapList[1]
    self.heapList[1] = self.heapList[self.currentSize]
    self.currentSize = self.currentSize - 1
    self.heapList.pop()
    self.percDown(1)
    return retval
```



build an entire heap from a list of keys.

build a heap by inserting each key one at a time.
- a list of one item, the list is sorted
- use binary search to find the right position to insert the next key at a cost of approximately `ùëÇ(logùëõ)` operations.
- However, inserting an item in the middle of the list may require `ùëÇ(ùëõ)` operations to shift the rest of the list over to make room for the new key.
- Therefore, to insert `ùëõ` keys into the heap would require a total of `ùëÇ(ùëõlogùëõ)` operations.


if we start with an entire list then we can build the whole heap in `ùëÇ(ùëõ)` operations.   

```py
def buildHeap(self, alist):
    i = len(alist) // 2
    self.currentSize = len(alist)
    self.heapList = [0] + alist[:]
    while (i > 0):
        self.percDown(i)
        i = i - 1
```

`percDown` method ensures that the largest child is always moved down the tree.
- Because the heap is a complete binary tree, any nodes past the halfway point will be leaves and therefore have no children.
- when `i=1`, we are percolating down from the root of the tree, so this may require multiple swaps.

As you can see in the rightmost two trees of Figure 4,
- first the 9 is moved out of the root position,
- but after 9 is moved down one level in the tree,
- percDown ensures that we check the next set of children farther down in the tree to ensure that it is pushed as low as it can go.
- In this case it results in a second swap with 3. Now that 9 has been moved to the lowest level of the tree, no further swapping can be done.
- It is useful to compare the list representation of this series of swaps as shown in Figure 4 with the tree representation.

```py
i = 2  [0, 9, 5, 6, 2, 3]
i = 1  [0, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3]
i = 0  [0, 2, 3, 6, 5, 9]
```


The assertion that we can build the heap in `ùëÇ(ùëõ)` is beyond the scope of this book. However, the key to understanding that you can build the heap in `ùëÇ(ùëõ)` is to remember that the `logùëõ` factor is derived from the height of the tree.

For most of the work in buildHeap, the tree is shorter than `logùëõ`

Using the fact that you can build a heap from a list in `ùëÇ(ùëõ)` time, you will construct a sorting algorithm that uses a heap and sorts a list in `ùëÇ(ùëõlogùëõ))` as an exercise at the end of this chapter.



#### analyze the binary heap

- find the smallest: `ùëÇ(1)`
- insert: `ùëÇ(logùëõ)`
- removal: `ùëÇ(logùëõ)`
