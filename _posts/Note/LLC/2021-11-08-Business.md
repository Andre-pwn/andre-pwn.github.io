## Company

### Business Structure

There are four primary company structures utilized by companies in the United States, which include:
- Sole Proprietorships
  - This option tends to be a better fit if you’re the sole owner of your company, plan to keep it small, and want to merge your personal and business taxes.
- Partnerships
  - This option may fit if there’s more than one major financial or practical stakeholder in your company and you’re looking to keep your costs as low as possible.
- Corporations
  - A corporation will work well if you want to issue stock in your business, favor a strict corporate structure, aim to grow rapidly and expansively, and you’re not intimidated by extensive reporting requirements.
- Limited Liability Companies
  - This model serves the interests of owners that don’t crave as much freedom from legally-imposed company restrictions as possible and don’t have an interest in issuing stock in their companies.
  - If the ins and outs of how to start an LLC in Virginia suit your needs, starting an LLC in Virginia will protect your personal assets from business-related legal burdens, promote a flexible management style, and allow you to employ a flexible approach to taxation.

**ALLERGENS ON LABELING**
The FDA lists nine (9) major food allergens. Listing any of these on your label is a smart business practice and will certainly help your customers choose a product.
- Milk
- Eggs
- Fish (e.g., bass, flounder, cod)
- Crustacean shellfish (e.g., crab, lobster, shrimp)
- Tree nuts (e.g., almonds, walnuts, pecans)
- Peanuts
- Wheat
- Soybeans
- Sesame seeds

In order to qualify for a permit to sell online or at craft shows, business owners must have a commercial grade kitchen that can be inspected by the state. But Emerson said this process can be expensive for a small business to do. She hopes the state will explore other options.


### HOME & COMMERCIAL KITCHEN-BASED BUSINESSES

Food establishments, including private homes, that manufacture, process, pack or hold food for sale are subject to the Virginia Food and Drink Law and related regulations. It is unlawful to operate as a food manufacturer, food storage warehouse, or retail food establishment until it has been inspected and has been issued a permit for the operation of the food establishment. (Note these exceptions from inspection.)

Enforcement of these requirements includes `regular periodic inspections of food establishments, including private homes`. VDACS’ Food Safety Specialists, also known as inspectors, ensure that any food or beverage manufactured, produced, processed, packed, exposed, offered, possessed or held for sale is safe for human consumption, and in compliance with the Virginia Food and Drink Law and related regulations. Inspectors look for evidence of unsanitary conditions, mislabeling and the mishandling of food products that can lead to unsafe foods. Manufacturers are subject to `unannounced inspections and sampling, as well as an annual fee`. Further guidance is available in the Additional Resources section below.

If you are interested in starting a catering company, please contact the Virginia Department of Health. Products containing meat are regulated by the Office of Meat and Poultry Services.
