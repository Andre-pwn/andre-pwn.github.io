## Company

### Business Structure

There are four primary company structures utilized by companies in the United States, which include:
- Sole Proprietorships
  - This option tends to be a better fit if you’re the sole owner of your company, plan to keep it small, and want to merge your personal and business taxes.
- Partnerships
  - This option may fit if there’s more than one major financial or practical stakeholder in your company and you’re looking to keep your costs as low as possible.
- Corporations
  - A corporation will work well if you want to issue stock in your business, favor a strict corporate structure, aim to grow rapidly and expansively, and you’re not intimidated by extensive reporting requirements.
- Limited Liability Companies
  - This model serves the interests of owners that don’t crave as much freedom from legally-imposed company restrictions as possible and don’t have an interest in issuing stock in their companies.
