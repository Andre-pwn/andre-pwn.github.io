### Business Structure

There are four primary company structures utilized by companies in the United States, which include:

- Sole Proprietorships
  - This option tends to be a better fit if you’re the sole owner of the company, plan to keep it small, and want to merge the personal and business taxes.
- Partnerships
  - This option may fit if there’s more than one major financial or practical stakeholder in the company and you’re looking to keep the costs as low as possible.
- Corporations
  - A corporation will work well if you want to issue stock in the business, favor a strict corporate structure, aim to grow rapidly and expansively, and you’re not intimidated by extensive reporting requirements.
- Limited Liability Companies
  - This model serves the interests of owners that don’t crave as much freedom from legally-imposed company restrictions as possible and don’t have an interest in issuing stock in their companies.
  - If the ins and outs of how to start an LLC in Virginia suit the needs, starting an LLC in Virginia will protect the personal assets from business-related legal burdens, promote a flexible management style, and allow you to employ a flexible approach to taxation.

INC

- short for “incorporated”, and it is the abbreviation that is often used to indicate that a business is a corporation. (Example: Time Inc.)
- When you incorporate a business, you evolve from a sole proprietorship (if you are the sole owner) or general partnership (if there are co-owners) into a company that’s formally recognized by its state of incorporation.

- In other words, it becomes a legal business entity of its own — separate from the individuals who founded it and the shareholders who will own it over the course of its existence.

LLC

- limited liability company (More on liability and liability protection later.)
- Similar to a corporation, when you form an LLC, you are forming a company with its own legal existence — separate from its founders and members (as the owners of LLCs are called).

#### formation processes

- To form a **corporation**, a document called the `Articles of Incorporation` filed with the state. The articles can be used to opt out of or change certain statutory requirements that the corporation will be subject to otherwise. Certain governing provisions also have to be included in the articles to be effective. After the Articles of Incorporation are issued by the state, an organizational meeting is held to adopt the corporate bylaws. These bylaws govern the internal management of a corporation and the rights of the shareholders. (Nonprofit bylaws are often referred to as resolutions.)

- The document filed by an **LLC** is called the `Articles of Organization`, which contains less information than is required for a corporation. The owners (or members) of the LLC should also create an operating agreement that covers the main provisions for how the LLC will be managed and to clarify the rights, duties, and liabilities of members and managers.

#### Inc. vs. LLC: Varying tax advantages and disadvantages

Both `LLCs` and `corporations (C corps and S corps)` have their own tax advantages and disadvantages.

**LLC**

- An LLC is a `pass-through` business entity for federal income tax purposes.

  - That means it `does not have to pay federal income tax`. Instead, its profits and losses go straight through to the owners.

  - Pass-through taxation is the default rule.
  - If you have more than one member, If you do nothing, the LLC will be taxed as a partnership under Subchapter K of the Internal Revenue Code.
  - if you are the only member, the LLC will be disregarded completely for income tax purposes

- `single level of taxation`

  - Business income equals personal income, so the owner pays the tax on his or her personal return, and it's taxed at the individual rate.
  - Since only the members pay tax, there is a `single level of taxation`
  - While a single level of taxation is a good thing, it doesn’t guarantee that being taxed as an LLC is better for you.

- In some circumstances, `LLC owners can earn a substantially increased tax bill through the addition of the self-employment tax, currently at 15.3 percent`.
  - And it can also depend upon whether the corporate or personal income tax rate is higher and what exemptions and deductions the owners are entitled to.
  - But if it is to the LLC’s advantage to be taxed as a corporation, you have that option.
  - You can file Form 8832 “Entity Classification Election” with the Treasury Department, and the LLC will be taxed as a corporation under `Subchapter C`.
  - if you so desire, and if the LLC qualifies, you also have the option to make a further filing to be taxed under `Subchapter S`.

**INC corporations**

- For corporations, there are two kinds for income tax purposes.

  - C corporations
    - be taxed under Subchapter C of the IRS.
    - C corporations are subject to double taxation.
  - S corporations
    - be taxed under Subchapter S of the IRC.
    - S corporations are subject to a single level of taxation.

- When you incorporate, the corporation, by default, will be taxed under `Subchapter C`.

  - the corporation is a separate taxable entity with the business’ profits and losses taxable to the corporation, not to the owners.
  - As a result, corporations are taxed at the corporate rate.
  - Then, if the corporation distributes its profits to the shareholders, say in the form of a dividend, that is income to the shareholders which they have to report on their personal income tax return.
  - It's a **double tax**, and it can seriously cut into the real dollars earned in the end.

- However, if the corporation qualifies, you can choose to have it taxed as an **S corporation**.

  - An S corporation (**Subchapter S corporations**) is a `pass-through` tax entity.
  - Although S corporations and LLCs have that in common Subchapter S has several restrictions that LLCs taxed as a partnership or disregarded entity are not subject to.

  - In order to be eligible to make an S corporation election—and to continue to be an S corporation

    - the corporation must meet strict requirements on the number and type of shareholders and types of shares.
    - These rules are imposed by federal tax law, and not state corporation law.
    - Briefly stated, these rules include the following:

      - Only `individuals, U.S. citizens or residents`, certain estates and trusts, and certain tax-exempt organizations can be shareholders
      - There `cannot be more than 100 shareholders` (although some family members can be counted as a single shareholder)
      - There can only be `one class of stock` (although differences in voting rights are permitted)

### federal and state tax IDs

**federal tax ID**

- Employer Identification Number (EIN) is the federal tax ID.
- You need it to pay federal taxes, hire employees, open a bank account, and apply for business licenses and permits.

- It's free to apply for an EIN, and you should do it right after you register the business.

- the business needs a federal tax ID number if it does any of the following:

  - Pays employees
  - Operates as a corporation or partnership
  - Files tax returns for employment, excise, or alcohol, tobacco, and firearms
  - Withholds taxes on income, other than wages, paid to a non-resident alien
  - Uses a Keogh Plan (a tax-deferred pension plan)
  - Works with certain types of organizations

- Step

  1. Apply for an EIN with the IRS assistance tool: [EIN Assistant](https://sa.www4.irs.gov/modiein/individual/index.jsp).

  2. The selection of S Corporation as the type of structure applying for an EIN.

  - We must initially classify you as a regular corporation.
  - In order to elect S corporation status for the organization, you will need to file Form 2553 (Election by a Small Business Corporation).
  - Once that form has been approved, we will update the account.
    - A corporation is a person or group of people who establish a legal entity by filing articles of incorporation with the state's secretary of state granting it certain legal powers, rights, privileges, and liabilities.
    - An S corporation is an eligible domestic corporation that wants to avoid double taxation (once to the shareholders and again to the corporation) by electing this status using Form 2553 (Election by a Small Business Corporation).
    - Generally, an S corporation is exempt from federal income tax other than tax on certain capital gains and passive income.
    - An S corporation is not a sole proprietor or partnership.

  3. Next Steps (for S-Corporations)

     - Complete and file Form 2553 (Election by a Small Business Corporation).
     - This form must be completed in a timely manner to receive S corporation status.
     - See the instructions for complete information.

  4. Acceptance or Non-Acceptance of Election

     - The service center will notify the corporation if its election is accepted and when it will take effect.
     - The corporation will also be notified if its election is not accepted.
     - The corporation should generally receive a determination on its election within 60 days after it has filed Form 2553.

  5. Corrections?
     - If you need to make changes to the organization's information, you must do so in writing and mail the information to the address provided at https://www.irs.gov/businesses/business-name-change.

   2. Various professional regulating bodies and regulated professions and occupations are listed on the DPOR website.
   3. Using dpor.virginia.gov, you should determine which other licenses controlled on the local or statewide level may be applicable for the business and submit the appropriate information to apply for those licenses.

5. Apply for federal licenses (as necessary)
   1. though the federal government does not require or issue any general business operating licenses, you may be required to obtain licenses with specific government agencies depending on the business’s industry.
   2. Common industries requiring federal permitting include farming, mining, firearms, alcohol sales and aviation.

**ALLERGENS ON LABELING**
The FDA lists nine (9) major food allergens. Listing any of these on the label is a smart business practice and will certainly help the customers choose a product.

- Milk
- Eggs
- Fish (e.g., bass, flounder, cod)
- Crustacean shellfish (e.g., crab, lobster, shrimp)
- Tree nuts (e.g., almonds, walnuts, pecans)
- Peanuts
- Wheat
- Soybeans
- Sesame seeds

In order to qualify for a permit to sell online or at craft shows, business owners must have a commercial grade kitchen that can be inspected by the state. But Emerson said this process can be expensive for a small business to do. She hopes the state will explore other options.

### HOME & COMMERCIAL KITCHEN-BASED BUSINESSES

> https://www.vdacs.virginia.gov/dairy-kitchen-food-services-businesses.shtml

Food establishments, including private homes, that manufacture, process, pack or hold food for sale are subject to the Virginia Food and Drink Law and related regulations. It is unlawful to operate as a food manufacturer, food storage warehouse, or retail food establishment until it has been inspected and has been issued a permit for the operation of the food establishment. (Note these exceptions from inspection.)

Enforcement of these requirements includes `regular periodic inspections of food establishments, including private homes`. VDACS’ Food Safety Specialists, also known as inspectors, ensure that any food or beverage manufactured, produced, processed, packed, exposed, offered, possessed or held for sale is safe for human consumption, and in compliance with the Virginia Food and Drink Law and related regulations. Inspectors look for evidence of unsanitary conditions, mislabeling and the mishandling of food products that can lead to unsafe foods. Manufacturers are subject to `unannounced inspections and sampling, as well as an annual fee`. Further guidance is available in the Additional Resources section below.

If you are interested in starting a catering company, please contact the Virginia Department of Health. Products containing meat are regulated by the Office of Meat and Poultry Services.
