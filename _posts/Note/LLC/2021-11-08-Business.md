## Company

### Business Structure

There are four primary company structures utilized by companies in the United States, which include:
- Sole Proprietorships
  - This option tends to be a better fit if you’re the sole owner of your company, plan to keep it small, and want to merge your personal and business taxes.
- Partnerships
  - This option may fit if there’s more than one major financial or practical stakeholder in your company and you’re looking to keep your costs as low as possible.
- Corporations
  - A corporation will work well if you want to issue stock in your business, favor a strict corporate structure, aim to grow rapidly and expansively, and you’re not intimidated by extensive reporting requirements.
- Limited Liability Companies
  - This model serves the interests of owners that don’t crave as much freedom from legally-imposed company restrictions as possible and don’t have an interest in issuing stock in their companies.
  - If the ins and outs of how to start an LLC in Virginia suit your needs, starting an LLC in Virginia will protect your personal assets from business-related legal burdens, promote a flexible management style, and allow you to employ a flexible approach to taxation.

### LLC of INC

INC
- short for “incorporated”, and it is the abbreviation that is often used to indicate that a business is a corporation. (Example: Time Inc.)
- When you incorporate a business, you evolve from a sole proprietorship  (if you are the sole owner) or general partnership (if there are co-owners) into a company that’s formally recognized by its state of incorporation.

- In other words, it becomes a legal business entity of its own — separate from the individuals who founded it and the shareholders who will own it over the course of its existence.


LLC
- limited liability company (More on liability and liability protection later.)
- Similar to a corporation, when you form an LLC, you are forming a company with its own legal existence — separate from its founders and members (as the owners of LLCs are called).


#### formation processes

- To form a **corporation**, a document called the `Articles of Incorporation` filed with the state. The articles can be used to opt out of or change certain statutory requirements that the corporation will be subject to otherwise. Certain governing provisions also have to be included in the articles to be effective. After the Articles of Incorporation are issued by the state, an organizational meeting is held to adopt the corporate bylaws. These bylaws govern the internal management of a corporation and the rights of the shareholders. (Nonprofit bylaws are often referred to as resolutions.)

- The document filed by an **LLC** is called the `Articles of Organization`, which contains less information than is required for a corporation. The owners (or members) of the LLC should also create an operating agreement that covers the main provisions for how the LLC will be managed and to clarify the rights, duties, and liabilities of members and managers.


#### Inc. vs. LLC: Varying tax advantages and disadvantages

Both `LLCs` and `corporations (C corps and S corps)` have their own tax advantages and disadvantages.

**LLC**
- An LLC is a `pass-through` business entity for federal income tax purposes. That means it `does not have to pay federal income tax`. Instead, its profits and losses go straight through to the owners.
  - Pass-through taxation is the default rule. If you do nothing, your LLC will be taxed as a partnership under Subchapter K of the Internal Revenue Code. This is the case when you have more than one member, or your LLC will be disregarded completely for income tax purposes if you are the only member.

- Business income equals personal income, so the owner pays the tax on his or her personal return, and it's taxed at the individual rate. Since only the members pay tax, there is a `single level of taxation`.

  - While a single level of taxation is a good thing, it doesn’t guarantee that being taxed as an LLC is better for you. In some circumstances, `LLC owners can earn a substantially increased tax bill through the addition of the self-employment tax, currently at 15.3 percent`. And it can also depend upon whether the corporate or personal income tax rate is higher and what exemptions and deductions the owners are entitled to.


- But if it is to your LLC’s advantage to be taxed as a corporation, you have that option. You can file Form 8832 “Entity Classification Election” with the Treasury Department, and your LLC will be taxed as a corporation under Subchapter C. Then, if you so desire, and if your LLC qualifies, you also have the option to make a further filing to be taxed under Subchapter S.


**corporations**

- For corporations, there are two kinds for income tax purposes.

  - C corporations
    - be taxed under Subchapter C of the IRS.
    - C corporations are subject to double taxation.
  - S corporations
    - be taxed under Subchapter S of the IRC.
    - S corporations are subject to a single level of taxation.

- When you incorporate, your corporation, by default, will be taxed under Subchapter C. Your corporation is a separate taxable entity with the business’ profits and losses taxable to the corporation, not to the owners.

- As a result, corporations are taxed at the corporate rate. Then, if the corporation distributes its profits to the shareholders, say in the form of a dividend, that is income to the shareholders which they have to report on their personal income tax return. It's a double tax, and it can seriously cut into the real dollars earned in the end.

- However, if your corporation qualifies, you can choose to have it taxed as an S corporation. An S corporation is a `pass-through` tax entity. Although S corporations and LLCs have that in common Subchapter S has several restrictions that LLCs taxed as a partnership or disregarded entity are not subject to.

- In order to be eligible to make an S corporation election—and to continue to be an S corporation
  - the corporation must meet strict requirements on the number and type of shareholders and types of shares. These rules are imposed by federal tax law, and not state corporation law. Briefly stated, these rules include the following:

  - Only individuals, U.S. citizens or residents, certain estates and trusts, and certain tax-exempt organizations can be shareholders
  - There cannot be more than 100 shareholders (although some family members can be counted as a single shareholder)
  - There can only be one class of stock (although differences in voting rights are permitted)

   2. Common industries requiring federal permitting include farming, mining, firearms, alcohol sales and aviation.



**ALLERGENS ON LABELING**
The FDA lists nine (9) major food allergens. Listing any of these on your label is a smart business practice and will certainly help your customers choose a product.
- Milk
- Eggs
- Fish (e.g., bass, flounder, cod)
- Crustacean shellfish (e.g., crab, lobster, shrimp)
- Tree nuts (e.g., almonds, walnuts, pecans)
- Peanuts
- Wheat
- Soybeans
- Sesame seeds

In order to qualify for a permit to sell online or at craft shows, business owners must have a commercial grade kitchen that can be inspected by the state. But Emerson said this process can be expensive for a small business to do. She hopes the state will explore other options.


### HOME & COMMERCIAL KITCHEN-BASED BUSINESSES

> https://www.vdacs.virginia.gov/dairy-kitchen-food-services-businesses.shtml

Food establishments, including private homes, that manufacture, process, pack or hold food for sale are subject to the Virginia Food and Drink Law and related regulations. It is unlawful to operate as a food manufacturer, food storage warehouse, or retail food establishment until it has been inspected and has been issued a permit for the operation of the food establishment. (Note these exceptions from inspection.)

Enforcement of these requirements includes `regular periodic inspections of food establishments, including private homes`. VDACS’ Food Safety Specialists, also known as inspectors, ensure that any food or beverage manufactured, produced, processed, packed, exposed, offered, possessed or held for sale is safe for human consumption, and in compliance with the Virginia Food and Drink Law and related regulations. Inspectors look for evidence of unsanitary conditions, mislabeling and the mishandling of food products that can lead to unsafe foods. Manufacturers are subject to `unannounced inspections and sampling, as well as an annual fee`. Further guidance is available in the Additional Resources section below.

If you are interested in starting a catering company, please contact the Virginia Department of Health. Products containing meat are regulated by the Office of Meat and Poultry Services.
