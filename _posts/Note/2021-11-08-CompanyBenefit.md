## Future Plan

- Trad 401(k): 170/pay
- Roth 401(k): 170/pay
- 401k: 170/pay

3 kinds of 401k:
- Traditional
- Roth
- After-Tax (this is the one where you pay taxes on growth upon withdrawal)

pay
- Your first `$23,000` + company Match goes into 1 or 2. 
- Everything above goes into After-Tax. 
- The key is: 
  - You are not allowed to contribute amounts over `$23,000` to Roth. 
  - But you are allowed to convert amounts over `$23,000` from After-Tax to Roth.


### 401k
Contribution types:
- choose to make the regular, catch-up, and commission contributions as Traditional 401(k), Roth 401(k), or both.
  - Traditional 401(k)
    - contributions are made **before-tax**.
    - Part of the paycheck goes in to the 401(k) account before the taxable income is calculated (other than Social Security).
    - This lowers the taxable income for the current year.
    - When you withdraw the money later, you pay taxes on the contributions and related earnings.
  - Roth 401(k)
    - contributions are made after-tax.
    - Part of the paycheck goes in to the account after it’s taxed as income.
    - So when you withdraw this money later, you won’t need to pay taxes or penalties (if you meet all requirements and conditions).


Loans:
- If you have a balance of `$2000` or more in the 401(k) Plan, you could be eligible to take out a loan against the funds in the 401(k) account. You’ll then repay this loan into the account using after-tax deductions from the paycheck. take out two types of loans:
  - A general-purpose loan (for any reason)
  - A residential loan (to help you buy a primary home)

Withdrawals:
- withdraw all or part of the balance in the 401(k) Plan account for the reasons below.
  - You have direct rollover contributions
  - You have After-tax contributions
  - You encounter financial hardship as defined by the IRS
  - You’re a qualified reservist called to active military service
  - You’re divorced and receive a Qualified Domestic Relations Order
  - You become permanently disabled and qualify for Long-Term Disability benefits
  - You reach age 59
  - Your employment ends
  - You reach the minimum required distribution (MRD) age
  - You pass away


### Mega Backdoor Roth - MBDR

> convert from a tax-deferred status in 401(k) --> to a Roth position that allows to pull out the contributions and growth tax free
> the conversions are from After-Tax 401(k) -> Roth IRA.

post-tax / roth conversions can be done automatically if the plan offers' it (Fidelity does):
a. Using Roth IRA: be limited to the Roth IRA contribution limits of `$7k`
b. Using Roth 401(k): There is no need for a conversion and no Roth IRA limits.

Considering the strategy makes use of 401(k) contribution limits:
- Pre-tax 401(k) contributions - pulled from the paycheck, `$23k` 2024 limit
- Post-tax (`$69k` 2024 limit - `$23k` - Employer Match)
  - Remaining amount left as an option to auto-contribute from our paycheck

- there is only a `$7k` limit for regular backdoor roth conversion (traditional IRA -> Roth IRA), and this limit does not apply for 401(k) roth conversions?

- 0 relationship between the 401(k) contributions (and their limits) and the IRA contributions (and their limits).

- the only advantage I can think of is that gains aren’t realized and taxed until you withdraw with the 401k. So you can reinvest full dividends and so on without tax burden until you pull the money out decades later. I suspect for most people you’d come out ahead paying long term capital gains on the brokerage vs income tax on the 401k withdrawals, but I’m sure there are some people that can benefit
