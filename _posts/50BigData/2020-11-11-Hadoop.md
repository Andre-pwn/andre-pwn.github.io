HDFS
- replication
- fault-tolerant

- Apache Hadoop
  - an open source framework for big data.
  - It is based on the <font color=red> MapReduce programming model </font> which Google invented and published.
    - <font color=red> "Map function" </font>
      - runs in parallel with a massive dataset to produce intermediate results.
    - <font color=red> "Reduce function" </font>
      - builds a final result set based on all those intermediate results.
  - The term "Hadoop" is often used informally to encompass Apache Hadoop itself, and related projects such as Apache Spark, Apache Pig, and Apache Hive.
