## Abustruct


In the recent years, high-dimensional data visualization has become a challenging task in data science and machine learning. As one of the most effective methods for high-dimensional data visualization, Parallel Coordinates Plots (PCPs) demonstrate dimensional reduction by transforming features of multivariate data into 2D axes. Such approach, however, does not consider the irrelevant or redundant features such that each feature is projected into the axis in a fixed manner. This paper proposed a novel PCP introduced by an unsupervised feature selection called Laplacian Score, which can be used to improve the visualization performance of PCP by ranking the importance of attributes based on their locality preserving power. The experimental results demonstrated that the performance of PCP visualization can be improved by feature selection method. Furthermore, we proposed a flexible user interface based on PCP visualization and Laplacian Score.
