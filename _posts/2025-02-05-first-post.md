# Welcome! | Herzlich willkommen! خوش آمدید!

Welcome to my blog! I'm Arman Torkzaban, and I'm excited to start this blogging journey. Here, I'll be sharing my thoughts with the world.

Why am I starting this blog? Because I cannot stomach the existing social networks' atmosphere, building a new one is unnecessary and too much of a hassle, and I want to have a permanent space where I offer you all that comes to my mind. My interests fall at the intersection of society, technology and justice. I am an activist and my volunteer work is mainly related to my two countries, Germany and Iran, so expect to read a lot about these.

In the coming weeks, expect to see posts about who I am, what I am doing, and what I am thinking about or planning to do. I'll be aiming to post twice a month.

I'd love to hear from you! Down below you can find my email address. Drop me a note!

Thanks for stopping by, and stay tuned for more!
