## Future Plan

Contribution types:
- You can choose to make your regular, catch-up, and commission contributions as Traditional 401(k), Roth 401(k), or both.
   - Traditional 401(k)
     - contributions are made **before-tax**.
     - Part of your paycheck goes in to your 401(k) account before your taxable income is calculated (other than Social Security).
     - This lowers your taxable income for the current year.
     - When you withdraw your money later, you pay taxes on the contributions and related earnings.
   - Roth 401(k)
     - contributions are made after-tax.
     - Part of your paycheck goes in to your account after it’s taxed as income.
     - So when you withdraw this money later, you won’t need to pay taxes or penalties (if you meet all requirements and conditions).


Loans:
- If you have a balance of `$2000` or more in the 401(k) Plan, you could be eligible to take out a loan against the funds in your 401(k) account. You’ll then repay this loan into your account using after-tax deductions from your paycheck. You can take out two types of loans:
  - A general-purpose loan (for any reason)
  - A residential loan (to help you buy a primary home)

Withdrawals:
- You can withdraw all or part of the balance in your 401(k) Plan account for the reasons below.
  - You have direct rollover contributions
  - You have After-tax contributions
  - You encounter financial hardship as defined by the IRS
  - You’re a qualified reservist called to active military service
  - You’re divorced and receive a Qualified Domestic Relations Order
  - You become permanently disabled and qualify for Long-Term Disability benefits
  - You reach age 59
  - Your employment ends
  - You reach your minimum required distribution (MRD) age
  - You pass away

```py
# 放满，每年避税1000+

(2300 + 610 )*0.35 = 1018.4999999999999

(7930 + 610 )*0.35 = 1977.5
```

- FSA - Health Care **Flexible Spending Account** 610
- LPFSA - Limited Purpose Health Care **Flexible Spending Account** 610
- Dependent Day Care **Flexible Spending Account** 5000

HSA:
- You can use an HSA to save before-tax money to pay for eligible `medical, dental, and vision expenses, like coinsurance, copays, and more`. Apple also contributes to your HSA with Optum Bank.
- If you have an account balance of `$2100` or greater, you can invest your money, and all earnings grow tax-free.
- At the end of the calendar year, any unused money rolls over.
- If you leave or retire, you can take the account with you, and you can use the money to pay for Medicare and other health expenses in retirement.
- *In several states, HSA contributions do not reduce taxable income for state income tax purposes*


FSA:
- You can enroll in a Health Care Flexible Spending Account to save before-tax money to use for eligible `medical, dental, and vision expenses like copays, coinsurance, and more`.
- At the end of the calendar year, up to `$610` of unused contributions will carry over to the following year as long as you re-enroll in a Health Care Flexible Spending Account; otherwise, it will be forfeited. For a list of eligible expenses, visit myuhc.com.



LPFSA:
- If you're enrolled in HSA, you aren't eligible for the traditional Health Care Flexible Spending Account (FSA), but you can participate in a Limited Purpose Health Care Flexible Spending Account.
- This account works the same way except that you **can only use it for certain dental and vision expenses** - you can't use a Limited Purpose Health Care FSA to pay for any medical expenses.
- At the end of the calendar year, up to `$610` of unused contributions will carry over to the following year as long as you re-enroll in a Limited Purpose Health Care Flexible Spending Account; otherwise, it will be forfeited. For a list of eligible expenses.

Dependent Day Care Flexible Spending Account:
- You can enroll in a Dependent Day Care Flexible Spending Account to save before-tax money to use for eligible dependent child care or elder care expenses so that you (or you and your spouse, if you're married) can work.
- Highly compensated employees may have their Dependent Day Care FSA annual contributions reduced in order for the plan to satisfy IRS requirements.
- If your spouse's or partner's employer has a Dependent Day Care FSA where the contributions typically are not reduced below `$5,000`, then consider if that plan is a better option for your family.
- You will be notified prior to any reduction. At the end of the calendar year, any unused contributions will be forfeited. For a list of eligible and ineligible expenses
- You can't use this account to get reimbursed for your dependents' health care expenses.
