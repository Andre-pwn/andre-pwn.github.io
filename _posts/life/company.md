      3. Meals, groceries, or snacks for your own consumption: As an S-corp owner, you are considered an employee of your company, BUT if you are the only employee, you cannot have a business meeting with yourself.
      4. If you are alone, then it isn't a business meal expense. Ordering UberEats for yourself while working through lunch at home/office, going to McDonald's to grab a quick bite, or ordering a latte at a coffee shop while working on your laptop doesn't count as a business meeting and is not a deductible meal expense. These meals are considered personal and should NOT be paid through your business accounts (debit card, credit card, etc.)
      5. Meal expenses incurred for spouses, dependents, or other individuals accompanying the taxpayer: So if your wife tags along to a business dinner with a client, that’s cool, but her meal would not be a deductible expense. Best practice would be for you to pay for the business meals using a business account and your wife's from your personal account.
