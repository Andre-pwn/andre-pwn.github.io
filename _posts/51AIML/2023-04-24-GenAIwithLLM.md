## Overall

**OpenSource**
- hugging face
- OpenAI
- Generative AI (answers for everything)

**Program**
- python
- panda

**AI modeling**
- pyTorch
- Tensor flow (Google)

**ML platforms**
- Jupyter Notebooks

**Time series**
- Forecasting and predictive Analytics

**Use case**
- Supply Chain Management with GenAI

OpenSource -> fine tuning -> custom result

## Traditional AIML vs GenAI

Traditional AIML
- good at **identify pattern**
- learning from the pattern
- limit success with close supervised learning of very large amount of data
- must have human involved


GenAI
- produces 'content' (text, image, music, art, forecasts, etc...)
- use 'transformers' (Encoders/Decoders) based on pre-trained data using small amount of fine tuning data
  - encode and decode at the same time
    - less data and faster
    - GenAI use small data and uses encoders and decoders and Transformers to take that smaller data and be able to use it for other types of models. (Pre training)
    - then add on top of it small amounts of fine tuning data
    - and then get a a training model.
  - As perceptions, not neurons.

## Attention is all you need

- high alignment

## subject thoery

GPU
- cloud class instance (from NVIDIA)
  - google colab
  - kaggle
  - amazon sagemaker
  - gradient
  - microsoft azure

> Tesla is graphics cards from NVIDIA for AI



pyTorch
- it does these heavy mathematical computation very easily with libraries
- it got a whole set of APIs and utilities that let you manipulate all of these different tensors



tensors
- a tensor is a computer data object (data structure) that represents numeric data,
- it could be floating point data values or data objects within data objects.
- 1d tensors (column)
- 2d tensors (xy)
- 3d tensors (xyz)
- 4d tensors (**cube**)
- 5d tensors
- 6d tensors

## Hugging Face

> like github repo

- search for an AI model
- Example 1: Generative AI Time Series Forecasting - https://huggingface.co/blog/time-series-transformers
- Example 2: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting - https://huggingface.co/blog/informer
- Example 3: Generative AI Transformers for Time Series Forecasting - https://huggingface.co/blog/autoformer


```bash
# +++++ Getting started with our git and git-lfs interface
# If you need to create a repo from the command line (skip if you created a repo from the website)
pip install huggingface_hub
# You already have it if you installed transformers or datasets
huggingface-cli login
# Log in using a token from huggingface.co/settings/tokens
# Create a model or dataset repo from the CLI if needed
huggingface-cli repo create repo_name --type {model, dataset, space}


# +++++ Clone your model or dataset locally
# Make sure you have git-lfs installed
# (https://git-lfs.github.com)
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/username/repo_name


# +++++ Then add, commit and push any file you want, including larges files
# save files via `.save_pretrained()` or move them here
git add .
git commit -m "commit from $USER"
git push


# +++++ In most cases, if you're using one of the compatible libraries, your repo will then be accessible from code, through its identifier: username/repo_name
# For example for a transformers model, anyone can load it with:
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("username/repo_name")
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("username/repo_name")
```

# install supporting puthon packages for Data Frame processing
# and for Progress Bar
!pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tqdm scikit-learn

# install only the older version of Torch
!pip install --ignore-installed \
