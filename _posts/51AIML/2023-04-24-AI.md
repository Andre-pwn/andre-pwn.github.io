## AI

- Artificial Intelligence refers to `the ability of computers to perform tasks that typically require human-level intellect`.
- AI is useful in many contexts, from automation to problem solving and merely trying to understand how humans think.

- But it is important to note that AI is only concerned with human intelligence for now – it could possibly go beyond that.

  - Many people correlate the word ‘Intelligence’ with only ‘Human Intelligence’. Just because a chicken may not be able to solve a mathematical equation doesn’t mean it won’t run when you chase it. It is ‘Intelligent’ enough to know it doesn’t want you to catch it 🐔🍗.

  - Intelligence spans a much wider spectrum, and practically expands to any living thing that can make decisions or carry out actions autonomously, even plants.


### Divisions of AI

- Artificial Intelligence is `centered around computers and their ability to mimic human actions and thought processes`.

- Programming and experiments have allowed humans to produce ANI systems. These can do things like classifying items, sorting large amounts of data, looking for trends in charts and graphs, code debugging, and knowledge representation and expression. But computers don’t think like humans, they merely mimic humans.

- This is evident in voice assistants such as `Google’s Assistant, Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, and Microsoft’s Cortana`. They are basic ANI programs that add ‘the human touch’. In fact, people are known to be polite to these systems simply because they combine computerized abilities with a human feel.

- These assistants have gotten better over the years but fail to reach high levels of sophistication when compared to their AGI counterparts.


There are two major divisions of AI:


#### Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)

- focused on a small array of similar tasks or a small task that is programmed only for one thing.
- ANI is not great in dynamic and complex environments and is used in only areas specific to it.
- Examples include self-driving cars, as well as facial and speech recognition systems.


#### Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)

- focused on a wide array of tasks and human activities.
- AGI is currently theoretical and is proposed to adapt and carry out most tasks in many dynamic and complex environments.
- Examples include J.A.R.V.I.S from Marvel’s _Iron Man_ and Ava from _Ex-Machina_.

## LLM - Large Language Model


- a deep learning model which consists of a `neural network` with billions of parameters, trained on distinctively large amounts of unlabelled data using self-supervised learning.

- At the core of all AI are algorithms. Algorithms are procedures or steps to carry out a specific task. The more complex the algorithm, the more tasks can be carried out and the more widely it can be applied. The aim of AI developers is to find the most complex algorithms that can solve and perform a wide array of tasks.

- The procedure to create a basic fruit recognition model using an simple analogy:

  1. There are two people: A teacher and a bot creator
  2. The bot creator creates random bots, and the teacher teaches and tests them on identifying some fruits
  3. The bot with the highest test score is then sent back to the creator as a base to make new upgraded bots
  4. These new upgraded bots are sent back to the teacher for teaching and testing, and the one with the highest test score is sent back to the bot creator to make new better bots.

  - This is an oversimplification of the process, but nevertheless it relays the concept. The Model/Algorithm/Bot is continuously trained, tested, and modified until it is found to be satisfactory. More data and higher complexity means more training time required and more possible modifications.

- the developer of the model can tweak a few things about the model but may not know how those tweaks might affect the results.
- A common example of this are neural networks, which have hidden layers whose deepest layers and workings even the creator may not fully understand.

- Self-supervised learning means that rather than the teacher and the bot creator being two separate people, it is one highly skilled person that can both create bots and teach them.
  - This makes the process much faster and practically autonomous.
  - The result is a bot or set of bots that are both sophisticated and complex enough to recognise fruit in dynamic and different environments.

- In the case of LLMs, the data here are human text, and possibly in various languages. The reason why the data are large is because the LLMs take in huge amounts of text data with the aim of finding connections and patterns between words to derive context, meaning, probable replies, and actions to these text.

- The results are models that seem to understand language and carry out tasks based on prompts they're given.

  - **ChatGPT**: the greatest achievement in this field as it amassed 100 million active users in 2 months from the day of its release.

### Features of LLMs


#### Translation

- LLMs that are trained on an array of languages rather than just one can be used for translation from one language to another.
- It's even theorised that large enough LLMs can find patterns and connections in other languages to derive meaning from unknown and lost languages, despite not knowing what each individual word may mean.


#### Automating Mundane Tasks 自动化日常任务

- Task automation has always been a major aim of AI development. Language models have always been able to carry out syntax analysis, finding patterns in text and responding appropriately.

- Large language models have an advantage with semantic analysis 语义分析, enabling the model to understand the underlying meaning and context, giving it a higher level of accuracy.

- This can be applied to a number of basic tasks like `text summarising, text rephrasing, and text generation`.


#### Emergent Abilities 新兴能力

- Emergent Abilities are `unexpected but impressive` abilities LLMs have due to the high amount of data they are trained on.

- These behaviours are usually discovered when the model is used rather than when it is programmed.

- Examples include multi-step arithmetic, taking college-level exams, and chain-of-thought prompting. 思维链提示

### Drawbacks of LLMs


### Hallucination

- An infamous outcome of Microsoft’s Sydney were instances when the AI gave responses that were either bizarre 异乎寻常, untrue, or seemed sentient 有感情.
- These instances are termed Hallucination, where the model gives answers or makes claims that are not based on its training data.


### Bias

- Sometimes, the data could be the source of the problem. If a model is trained on data that is discriminatory to a person, group, race, or class, the results would also tend to be discriminatory.

- Sometimes, as the model is being used, the bias could change to fit what users tend to input. Microsoft’s Tay in 2016 was a great example of how bias could go wrong.

### Glitch tokens

- Also known as adversarial examples 对抗性示例, glitch tokens are inputs given to a model to intentionally make it malfunction and be inaccurate when delivering answers.

## GenAI


### Traditional AIML vs GenAI

Traditional AIML
- good at **identify pattern**
- learning from the pattern
- limit success with close supervised learning of very large amount of data
- must have human involved


GenAI
- produces 'content' (text, image, music, art, forecasts, etc...)
- use 'transformers' (Encoders/Decoders) based on pre-trained data using small amount of fine tuning data
  - encode and decode at the same time
    - less data and faster
    - GenAI use small data and uses encoders and decoders and Transformers to take that smaller data and be able to use it for other types of models. (Pre training)
    - then add on top of it small amounts of fine tuning data
    - and then get a a training model.
  - As perceptions, not neurons.
