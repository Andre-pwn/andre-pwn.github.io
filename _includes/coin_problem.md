## Coin Flipping Problem
> Flip a fair coin 100 timesâ€”it gives a sequence of heads (H) and tails (T). For each HH in the sequence of flips, Alice gets a point; for each HT, Bob does, so e.g. for the sequence THHHT Alice gets 2 points and Bob gets 1 point. Who is most likely to win?

In my first two attempts at solving this problem, I guessed each wrong answer (tie and Alice). **The correct answer is Bob**, don't feel bad if you can't intuit your way to the solution. Instead of relying on instincts, we can use Markov Chain Theory to mathematically prove the probability. But before doing this, we need to translate the problem to mathematical terms. The simplest way to do this is:

$$
\begin{gather*}
t = \{1, ..., 100\}, X_t = \{H, T\}, P(X_t = \text{H}) = P(X_t = \text{T}) = \frac{1}{2} \\
Z_t = \text{Event that Alice wins at turn $t$} \\
Y_t = \text{Event that Bob wins at turn $t$} \\
P(Z_{100}) \stackrel{?}{>} P(Y_{100})
\end{gather*}
$$

Although intuitive (as its a direct translation of the problem), I wont proceed further with this approach because it becomes very difficult to analyze. This is the second trap of the problem, because each random variable only models a single time index ($t$), but the core of this problem requires us to model two time steps (namely, $HH$ and $HT$). I got this idea from this [stackoverflow post](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/643092/coin-flip-game-hh-vs-ht-in-a-sequence-of-flips), and will try to explain it now. First, let's map our intuitive state space (the space of all possible states) into a more useful state space:

$$
\begin{gather*}
\{X_{t - 1} = H, X_{t} = H\} \rightarrow HH \\ 
\{X_{t - 1} = H, X_{t} = T\} \rightarrow HT \\
\{X_{t - 1} \neq H, X_t = H\} \rightarrow H \\
\{X_t = T\} \rightarrow NULL \\
\end{gather*}
$$

This might seem superficial, but it allows us to track the two scoring states ($HH$, $HT$), the state before scoring ($H$), and discard the rest ($NULL$). More importantly, this formulation requires us to remember only the most recent state, ($HH$, $HT$, $H$, $NULL$), when determining what might happen next. This is known as the [*Markov Property*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_property) and directly leads to a Markov Chain specification.

> Coming up with this formulation was often the most difficult part of Markov Chain analysis for me in school. Indeed, with this specified, First Step and Markov Chain analysis becomes a probability calculation.

Now we can write out the Markov Chain's transition matrix:

|      | $NULL$  | $H$ | $HH$ | $HT$ |
| -----| ----- |---|----|----|
| $NULL$ | 1/2   |1/2| 0   | 0 |
| $H$    | 0     |0  | 1/2 |1/2|
| $HH$   | 0     |0  | 1/2 |1/2|
| $HT$   | 1/2   |1/2|  0  |  0|

The way you can interpret this table as starting in a row (i.e. $NULL$) and each entry in those columns are the chances of transitioning into that state. For example, starting in $NULL$, you have a $\frac{1}{2}$ chance of rolling a $H$ but its impossible i.e. 

$$
P(X_t = HH | X_{t - 1} = NULL) = 0
$$

To go from $NULL$ to a $HH$. Notice how the sum of each row will always equal 1, indicating that we will always transition to *a* state next flip. **The key here is that since we constructed the definitions of our states to only exist on its previous state and still be meaningful in terms of the problem, we can construct such a table**.

This table can also be visualized in a flow chart:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    NULL -->|1/2| NULL
    NULL -->|1/2| H
    H -->|1/2| HH
    HH -->|1/2| HH
    HH -->|1/2| HT
    HT -->|1/2| H
    H -->|1/2| HT
    HT -->|1/2| NULL
```
With each arrow indicating a state transition according to the probability from the table.

We now need one more set of random variables, $Z_t$ and $Y_t$:

$$
\begin{gather*}
Z_t = \text{Alice's points at turn $t$} \in \{0, ..., 100\} \\
Y_t = \text{Bob's points at turn $t$} \in \{0, ..., 100\} \\
\end{gather*}
$$

I am pretty sure Bob's max points is only 50 (alternating $HT$ for 50 times), but if we use $\{0, ..., 100\}$ is makes the code easier and doesn't change the answer ðŸ˜€. Lets stack all three random variables $(X_t, Z_t, Y_t)$ into a vector:

$$
\begin{gather*}
\vec S_t = [X_t, Z_t, Y_t]
\end{gather*}
$$

Now for the calculation part, we simply need to compute $P(\vec S_{100})$. To do this, lets first use the [*law of total probability*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_total_probability) and the [*chain rule of probability*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule_(probability)) to condition on $\vec S_{99}$:

$$
\begin{gather*}
P(\vec S_{100}) = \sum_{\vec S_{99}} P(\vec S_{100}, \vec S_{99}) \\ 
= \sum_{\vec S_{99}} P(\vec S_{100} | \vec S_{99}) P(\vec S_{99})
\end{gather*}
$$

Actually, we can keep going, lets condition on $\vec S_{98}$ as well:

$$
\begin{gather*}
P(\vec S_{100}) = \sum_{\vec S_{99}} P(\vec S_{100} | \vec S_{99}) P(\vec S_{99}) \\ 
= \sum_{\vec S_{98}}\sum_{\vec S_{99}} P(\vec S_{100}, \vec S_{98} | \vec S_{99}) P(\vec S_{99}, \vec S_{98}) \\ 
= \sum_{\vec S_{98}}\sum_{\vec S_{99}} P(\vec S_{100} | \vec S_{99}) P(\vec S_{99} | \vec S_{98}) P(\vec S_{98}) \\ 
\end{gather*}
$$

Crucially, once we condition $\vec S_{100}$ on $\vec S_{99}$, $\vec S_{100}$ becomes conditionally independent from $\vec S_{98}$. Again, this is the *Markov Property* we are using. We can continue this pattern all the way down to $\vec S_1$:

$$
\begin{gather*}
P(\vec S_{100}) = \sum_{\vec S_{1}}...\sum_{\vec S_{98}}\sum_{\vec S_{99}} P(\vec S_{100} | \vec S_{99}) P(\vec S_{99} | \vec S_{98}) P(\vec S_{98} | \vec S_{97}) ... P(\vec S_{2} | \vec S_{1}) P(\vec S_1) \\ 
\end{gather*}
$$

From our transition table above, we always know:
$$
P(\vec S_{t} | \vec S_{t-1})
$$ 
and we can create a dummy timestep $t=0$ representing the state before the first flip as:

$$
\begin{gather*}
P(\vec S_0 = [Null, 0, 0]) = 1
\end{gather*}
$$

Technically, you would have to then add the condition: 

$$
P(\vec S_1 | \vec S_0) P(\vec S_0)
$$ 

to our expression for $P(\vec S_{100})$, but for clarity I will suppress this.

### Computational Tricks

We now explain three computational tricks. These aren't required from a mathematical perspective, but to get the correct answer using `numpy` in a reasonable amount of time, we need them. First:

$$
\begin{gather*}
P(\vec S_{100}) = \sum_{\vec S_{1}}...\sum_{\vec S_{98}}\sum_{\vec S_{99}} P(\vec S_{100} | \vec S_{99}) P(\vec S_{99} | \vec S_{98}) P(\vec S_{98} | \vec S_{97}) ... P(\vec S_{2} | \vec S_{1}) P(\vec S_1) \\ 
= \sum_{\vec S_{99}} P(\vec S_{100} | \vec S_{99}) \sum_{\vec S_{98}} P(\vec S_{99} | \vec S_{98}) \sum_{\vec S_{97}} P(\vec S_{98} | \vec S_{97}) ... \sum_{\vec S_{1}} P(\vec S_{2} | \vec S_{1}) P(\vec S_1)
\end{gather*}
$$

This allow us to compute the most far right part first, and store it. Consider after we compute the right most part 

$$
P(\vec S_{2}) = \sum_{\vec S_{1}} P(\vec S_{2} | \vec S_{1}) P(\vec S_1)
$$

When you are working further left to $\vec S_3$ and so on, $P(\vec S_{2})$ will not change since it is a constant. So instead of recomputing this term several times, we can simply cache it and refer to it later in the computation. Congrats, you just learned [Dynamic Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming) and [sum-product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief_propagation#Description_of_the_sum-product_algorithm) inference!

The second trick is that to have numerical stability computing the product of these small probabilities, we will compute $P(\vec S_{100})$ in log-space i.e. $\log P(\vec S_{100})$:

$$
\begin{gather*}
\log P(\vec S_{100}) = \log \big [\sum_{\vec S_{99}} P(\vec S_{100} | \vec S_{99}) \sum_{\vec S_{98}} P(\vec S_{99} | \vec S_{98}) \sum_{\vec S_{97}} P(\vec S_{98} | \vec S_{97}) ... \sum_{\vec S_{1}} P(\vec S_{2} | \vec S_{1}) P(\vec S_1) \big ] \\
=\log \sum_{\vec S_{99}} \exp \log \big [P(\vec S_{100} | \vec S_{99}) \sum_{\vec S_{98}} P(\vec S_{99} | \vec S_{98}) \sum_{\vec S_{97}} P(\vec S_{98} | \vec S_{97}) ... \sum_{\vec S_{1}} P(\vec S_{2} | \vec S_{1}) P(\vec S_1)\big ] \\ 
=\log \sum_{\vec S_{99}} \exp \log P(\vec S_{100} | \vec S_{99}) + \log \big [\sum_{\vec S_{98}} P(\vec S_{99} | \vec S_{98}) \sum_{\vec S_{97}} P(\vec S_{98} | \vec S_{97}) ... \sum_{\vec S_{1}} P(\vec S_{2} | \vec S_{1}) P(\vec S_1)\big ] \\ 
... \text{ Continue converting each product using $\exp \log [\cdot]$ } ... \\
=\log \sum_{\vec S_{99}} \exp \log P(\vec S_{100} | \vec S_{99}) + \log \sum_{\vec S_{98}} \exp \log P(\vec S_{99} | \vec S_{98}) +  ...  + \log\sum_{\vec S_{1}} \exp \log P(\vec S_{2} | \vec S_{1}) P(\vec S_1) \\ 
=\log \sum_{\vec S_{99}} \exp \log P(\vec S_{100} | \vec S_{99}) + \log \sum_{\vec S_{98}} \exp \log P(\vec S_{99} | \vec S_{98}) +  ... + \log\sum_{\vec S_{1}} \exp \log P(\vec S_{2} | \vec S_{1}) + \log P(\vec S_1) \\ 
=LSE_{\vec S_{99}} \log P(\vec S_{100} | \vec S_{99}) + LSE_{\vec S_{98}} \log P(\vec S_{99} | \vec S_{98}) + ... + LSE_{\vec S_{1}} \log P(\vec S_{2} | \vec S_{1}) + \log P(\vec S_1) \\ 
\end{gather*}
$$

Where $LSE_x$ stands for [Logarithm Summation Exponentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LogSumExp) which happens enough times in probability that `numpy` & `scipy` has given it a [special addition implementation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.logaddexp.html) and [special summation implementation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.special.logsumexp.html). And lastly, just add the index $t$ to the vector itself for bookkeeping. This is not a random variable, but is useful to index into a specific time index.

### Joint Probability of t=100

With the entire joint probability computed, we know need to marginalize the last time index $t=100$ for the joint distribution of $P(Z_{100}, Y_{100})$:

$$
\begin{equation}
P(Z_{100}, Y_{100}) = \sum_{X_{100}} P(X_{100}, Z_{100}, Y_{100}, 100)
\end{equation}
$$


```python
# Fix the last time step, and sum over the X_{100} dimension
log_probs_final = logsumexp(log_probs[..., -1], axis=0)

# Compute joint probability distribution of points
probs_joint = np.exp(log_probs_final)
```


```python

### Probability of Winning

For the last step, we need to marginalize over $P(Z_{100}, Y_{100})$, but when we do the summation, bucket an Alice win, tie, and Bob win into 3 separate categories. Specifically, create:

$$
\begin{gather*}
W_t = \text{Outcome of the game at round $t$} \in \{\text{Alice wins}, \text{tie}, \text{Bob wins}\} \\ 
P(W_{100}) = \sum_{Z_{100}, Y_{100}} P(Z_{100}, Y_{100}) \\ 
\log P(W_{100}) = \log \sum_{Z_{100}, Y_{100}} \exp \log P(Z_{100}, Y_{100})
\end{gather*}
$$

Now we just need to sum over $\log P(Z_{100} = z, Y_{100} = y)$ and for each $(z, y)$ combination, keep a running tally of the probability mass:


```python
# Initialize log-probabilities
log_probs_win = np.full(3, -np.inf)
names = ["Alice Wins", "Tie", "Bob Wins"]

# Compute log-probabilities of Alice winning, tie, or Bob winning.
for a in range(N + 1):
    for b in range(N + 1):
        if a > b:
            log_probs_win[0] = np.logaddexp(log_probs_win[0], log_probs_final[a, b])
        elif a == b:
            log_probs_win[1] = np.logaddexp(log_probs_win[1], log_probs_final[a, b])
        else:
